artplt001	Yes?  Would you like a free pirate caricature?
artplt002	Yes.  To help promote the zany, swashbuckling atmosphere of Planet Threepwood,
artplt003	Ozzie Mandrill Enterprises has hired me, Kristopher Kilometer, to render free 'pirate-themed' caricatures of our guests.
artplt004	Would you like one?
artplt005	Wonderful.  Just a moment.
artplt006	Hmmm...
artplt007	You know what I like about pirates?
artplt008	They're so active and healthy.  Ya know, all that swordfighting and sailing.  Really outdoorsy stuff.
artplt009	What's your favorite pirate activity?
artplt010	Suit yourself.
artplt011	Swordfighting, got it.
artplt012	Gunplay, got it.
artplt013	Hmph, I've heard that.
artplt014	Whatever you say.  Let me know if you change your mind.
artplt015	You know what else I like about pirates?
artplt016	Their wacky, madcap accessories!
artplt017	Pegs, patches, parrots, hooks...they're just so darned whimsical!
artplt018	So, what's your favorite pirate accessory?
artplt019	Peg legs...m'hmmmm.
artplt020	Patches...this is great.
artplt021	I think parrots are cute, too.
artplt022	You know what I can't figure about pirates?
artplt023	What do they do in their spare time?
artplt024	They can't spend their entire lives fighting, sailing, and wenching, can they?
artplt025	Of course not!
artplt026	So, what do you think pirates do in their off hours?
artplt027	Books...yes.
artplt028	Eww.
artplt029	I have no idea what it is, but I'll try to draw it.
artplt030	Oooh, good one.  Hold it...
artplt031	And I was almost done, too.  Huh, well, let me know if you change your mind.
artplt032	Hmmm...yes...
artplt033	Done!
artplt034	Here you are, sir.
artplt035	Thank you for your patronage, and enjoy your visit to the Happiest Island on Earth.
artplt036	You already got a caricature.  Don't be greedy.
artplt037	Oh, all right.
babm001	Hmm.  Yes.  Hmm.  Well, everything seems to be in order, Mister Marley-
babm003a	As you wish, sir.
babm003b	If you'll just follow me into the vault,
babm003c	we can open up your grandfather-in-law's safe deposit chest.
babm004	Ummph. Ahhh. Well, here it is, sir: the safe deposit chest of H.T. Marley, just as he left it over 20 years ago.
babm004a	Ummph. Ahhh. Well, here it is, sir:
babm004b	the safe deposit chest of H.T. Marley,
babm004c	just as he left it over 20 years ago.
babm006	That Governor Marley was an eccentric old salt, wasn't he? Huh. Ha. We were all crushed when he disappeared off the face of the Earth like he did.  Anyway, well I've got some loans to turn down.  You just let me know when you're done here, and I'll come running.
babm006a	That Governor Marley was an eccentric old salt, wasn't he? Huh. Ha.
babm006b	We were all crushed when he disappeared off the face of the Earth like he did.
babm006c	Anyway, well I've got some loans to turn down.
babm006d	You just let me know when you're done here, and I'll come running.
babm008	Mister Threepwood!  What are you doing out here?
babm010	Well, you really should've called me first.  We have rules about leaving the vault unattended.
babm010a	Well, you really should've called me first.
babm010b	We have rules about leaving the vault unattended.
babm012	And I'll see if a can scrounge up a Grog.
bagb002	That's 'Mister Threepwood.'
bagb005	Wow!  What an amazing collection of...junk.  Why would Grandpa Marley store garbage like this in a bank?
bagb005a	Wow!  What an amazing collection of...junk.
bagb005b	Why would Grandpa Marley store garbage like this in a bank?
bagb007	Gee...thanks. Well, I guess I better start looking for that deed to the Governor's Mansion, so I can get home to Elaine. Hm. Let's see now...hot water bottle...monkey pacifier...grogamints...Jimmy Hoffa...um do it yourself tattoo kit...uh bloody stiletto knife...bottomless mug...
bagb007a	Gee...thanks.
bagb007b	Well, I guess I better start looking for that deed to the Governor's Mansion,
bagb007c	so I can get home to Elaine.
bagb007d	Hm. Let's see now...
bagb013	Wax lips...wax lips? Ah, there it is!
bagb015	Yikes!
bagb016	Who are you supposed to be?
bagb018	No you're not.
bagb020	Well, for one thing, Guybrush is much better looking than you are. Sniff sniff. And for another the REAL Guybrush doesn't smell like anchovy halitosis.  Whew!
bagb020a	Well, for one thing, Guybrush is much better looking than you are.
bagb020b	Sniff sniff.
bagb020c	And for another the REAL Guybrush doesn't smell like anchovy halitosis.  Whew!
bagb022	I knew that deregulated banking would lead to this.
baibas001	Nine kinds of dead fish!  Huh?
baibas002	Hey.  You haven't seen my termites have ya?
baibas003	They seem to have disappeared.
baibas004	Ya know, I had figured you as a suspect.
baibas005	But now I know ya don't have the wits to have done it.  Ha ha.
baibas006	You're back, eh?  Can't resist the smell of fresh bait?  Huh?
baibas007	Hey!
baibas008	Ya don't like it?  Leave!
baibas009	Hey!  Take that outside!  You're scaring me bait!
baibas010	Only one per customer!
baibas011	Please leave the termites alone!
baibas012	They're a very temperamental group of performers, you know, and they must not be disturbed!
baibas013	Don't touch that, you'll contaminate the bait preparation zone!
baibas014	I told you to stay away from there!
baibas015	That's not our entire selection, ya know!
baibas016	Oh, that's just how I get rid of my expired bait, see.
baibas017	Are you kiddin'?
baibas018	That WAS the bait!
baibas019	Yes?
baibas020	No!
baibas021	No!!
baibas022	No!!!
baibas023	No!  We only have fish bait!
baibas024	Stop askin' me for non-fish seducin' bait!
baibas025	For the last time...
baibas026	Oh, yes...
baibas027	That free stuff over there will work fine.
baibas029	Ah, it stinks!
baibas030	No, I mean it's horrible.
baibas031	Nope.  It still stinks.
baibas032	Hmm, that sounds like Pegnose Pete.
baibas033	Are you kiddin'?  Everyone on Lucre Island™ has heard of Pegnose Pete.
baibas034	Eh, like what?
baibas035	Well, I used to sell termites as bait, see...
baibas036	...but most deep sea fishermen prefer something with a bit more...
baibas037	Meat.
baibas038	Anyway, when bait sales started tailing off, I took all my termites and trained them to do circus tricks, yeah.
baibas039	I... I even got the act approved by the newly-formed LucreArts Entertainment Consortium.
baibas040	Ahh, not really.  I have to kick most of my profits back to the head of the Consortium.  Why that ru...
baibas041	Ahh.  You get used to it after a while...
baibas042	...and come to miss it when you're out and about.
baibas043	That's why I never bathe, see...
baibas044	So I can keep that sweet, sweet scent of fish entrails with me wherever I go!  Ahh!
baibas045	Well, that bait is nearly expired.
baibas046	I need to get rid of it before it goes bad.
baibas047	Oh, the usual ways...
baibas048	...falls in with the wrong crowd, starts rebelling against authority, begins dating bait of loose virtue...
baibas049	...and before ya know it, the bait's gone bad!
baibas050	Well ya look all you like, but if you break it, you bought it.
baibas051	Well, it may be the chum talkin',
baibas052	...but I could swear that Lucre Island™ is getting less and less...pirate-friendly, see.
baibas053	Why, we've been besieged!
baibas054	Worse, tourists!  Ah!
baibas055	There aren't many of 'em around today, but ya hang around for a week, and they'll pop up like a bloated corpse in a calm sea.
baibas056	Why they... they've been driving some of Lucre's oldest pirate-oriented businesses into new fields,
baibas057	...and have compelled some of our nastier pirates to consider new lifestyle choices.  Hmm.
baibas058	Why, I myself have soiled my once-noble bait shoppe with a cheesy termite circus,
baibas059	...in a desperate attempt to get me hands on some of those tourist shekels.
baibas060	Not very well.  Insects seem to repel tourists almost as much as fish guts.
baibas061	Well I tried that!
baibas062	No.
baibas063	In fact, it seemed to drive prospective customers away!
baibas064	That's when I realized, eh, that something strange is going on, yeah.
baibas065	Yeah, me too.  It always seemed to work in the past.
baibas066	Oh, he's the most notorious thief on Lucre Island™!
baibas067	He's NEVER been caught...
baibas068	And his loot has NEVER been recovered...
baibas069	Ah, and his true face (aside from his trademark false nose) has NEVER been seen, see!
baibas070	Yeah, right.  And I've seen a bucket of chum solve complex math problems.  Heh heh.
baibas071	Eh, ya can't.
baibas072	Nobody can.
baibas073	There's a rumor that his hideout is somewhere in the heart of the Mystes O' Tyme Marshe--
baibas074	--But no one has ever been able to navigate their way through the Marshe without getting hopelessly lost.  It's cursed.
baibas075	Are you deaf or something?
baibas076	I said ya CAN'T find Pegnose...
baibas077	Not unless you navigate the cursed Mystes O' Tyme Marshe!
baibas078	Ooh, that's one of the darkest mysteries of Lucre Island™.
baibas079	Heh, some would have you believe that Pegnose's proud proboscis was pecked off by a duck...
baibas080	Heh, b...but I believe it was a school of deranged flounder that made off with his honker, uh huh.
baibas081	Well, no, but it sounds more ominous that way.
baibas082	Ah, awful!
baibas083	Well, whatever skins your salmon.
bapp009	I was, um, I was looking for a Grog machine.  Rummaging through family heirlooms is thirsty work.
bapp009a	I was, um, I was looking for a Grog machine.
bapp009b	Rummaging through family heirlooms is thirsty work.
bapp011	Gee, I'm sorry, I'll go back to the vault.
bapp014	Stick 'em up!
bapp017	Isn't obvious?  I'm Guybrush Threepwood!
bapp019	What makes you say that?
bapp021	All right, me bucko, that's enough of that!  Back away form the Marley heirlooms, and be quick about it!  Now, Mister Threepwood, take a good long look at the last face you'll ever see! He he he.
bapp021a	All right, me bucko, that's enough of that!
bapp021b	Back away from the Marley heirlooms, and be quick about it!
bapp021c	Now, Mister Threepwood,
bapp021d	take a good long look at the last face you'll ever see!  He he he.
barscu001	Well what's wrong with the ones you've already got?
barscu002	Sure.
barscu003	That you are.
barscu004	What can I do for ya' Mister Marley?
barscu005	Ah, right.  Sorry about that, Mister Threepwood.
barscu006	Isn't it a cryin' shame?  It's been that way since that Australian blew into town.
barscu007	Aye.  A scurrilous Australian land developer who's been using strong-arm tactics to buy up all the land on Mêlée Island™.
barscu008	Half of our regular clientele have been driven off-island by the no-good scoundrel.
barscu009	Mmm not really.
barscu010	I'd surely love to give him a piece of my mind, though.
barscu011	Ooh.  That sounds like fun...
barscu012	...but I should really check with my boss first.
barscu013	<whistle> HEY, BOSS!
barscu014	CAN I HAVE A FEW DAYS OFF TO JOIN MISTER THREEPWOOD HERE ON A SWASHBUCKLING ADVENTURE?
barscu015	I guess I can't go.  Damn.
barscu016	I'll check.
barscu017	HEY, BOSS--
barscu018	He sounds pretty adamant.
barscu019	I've got some pretzels...
barscu020	Yup, the SCUMM Bar's Famous Kudu Jerky Pretzels.
barscu021	Sorry, can't give you any.
barscu022	That drunk at the table over there -- he has the last basket.
barscu023	Sorry, it's SCUMM Bar policy.
barscu024	You really don't want to carry these babies around in your bare hands.
barscu025	That's the spirit!  See if the inebriated fellow over there'll see fit to give you some.
barscu026	You know, you're the first person to ever ask for seconds.
barscu027	Sorry, you'll have to finish the ones you've got there, first.
barscu028	Quit yer whinin'.
barscu029	Why I'll be glad to...after you show me some ID.
barscu030	No, really, ID!
barscu031	Like what?
barscu032	Do tell.
barscu033	Right well, grog'll do that.
barscu034	I'm done.
barscu035	Hey, don't be bad-mouthin' Mister Charles.
barscu036	You heard me...Charles L. Charles is the FUTURE of Mêlée Island™!
barscu037	I empathize.
barscu038	Well that's a cryin' shame, Mister Threepwood.
barscu039	Hmmm, you know, there's probably a pirate or two hanging around that could be coaxed into joining your crew.
barscu040	Hmmm, my boss is a navigator.
barscu041	He's probably sitting near that fireplace over there.
barscu042	Hmmmm.
barscu043	Well it may be the kudu talking, but I could swear that I saw a couple of unemployed pirates lollygaging about in the middle of town.
barscu044	Maybe they can be talked into joining your crew.
barscu045	Really.  Well, I think you've had just about enough grog for one evening.
barscu046	All the better.
barscu047	You might want to try the Mêlée Island™ Municipal Shipyards.
barscu048	Oh, no no.  The whole place is run by the Harbormistress these days.
barscu049	Aye, she's very by-the-book...although, hmm,  she does have her tender side.
barscu050	The Mêlée Island™ Municipal Shipyards.
barscu051	Agh.  You'd be surprised how often I hear that, Mister Threepwood.
barscu052	Oh, Lord yes.
barscu053	Put a few pints of grog into just about any pirate you meet these days...
barscu054	and he'll start telling you about how he feels like he's lost control of his life...
barscu055	and how it's all he can do to hold onto a world that seems to be spinning faster and faster with every passing day.
barscu056	That's something to consider.
barscu057	You and me both, brother.
barscu058	You do if you want any grog.
barscu059	Since unscrupulous Australian developers started trying to get our grog license revoked!
barscu060	Well, either ya change your pants, or you don't get any grog.
barscu061	Well, then...no grog for you!
barscu062	Actually, you look like you're about 15...
barscu063	But we're carding anyone who looks under 23, just to be safe.
barscu064	If your wife hadn't neglected her duties for so long, she wouldn't have been declared dead, now would she?
barscu065	Besides, the way I hear it, Charles is going to build a gigantic roller coaster over the remains of your decadent mansion.
barscu066	Now I ask you, what does Mêlée Island™ need more:
barscu067	A luxurious, tax-draining symbol of the bourgeois pirate plutocracy...
barscu068	Or a really bitchin' cool roller coaster?
barscu069	Aye, perhaps...but what if he's telling the truth, and it just happens to be what we want to hear?
barscu070	Nope, normally, I'd agree with you...
barscu071	But let's face it; we pirates do a pretty crummy job of governing ourselves...
barscu072	I think it's time for a change.
barscu073	So?
barscu074	It's not as though personal hygiene has ever been a high priority for us pirates.
barscu075	Agreed.
bgllua001	Why hello!
bgllua002	Great getup!
bgllua003	Whoa, you look really authentic.  Just like a, ya know, a real swashbuckler!
bgllua004	Do you work here?
bgllua005	Whoa, you really get into character!
bgllua006	Oh, I like everything.
bgllua007	Well, don't tell anyone, heh, but I don't like it either.
bgllua008	But everyone else is eating it, and ya know after all, isn't that what real pirates eat?
bgllua009	I've heard the flaming scuttlefish is the way to go if you don't like sushi, though.
bgllua010	Really?  More than this?
bgllua011	Whoa, sounds great!
bgllua012	But, uh, what's grog?
bgllua013	Yeah, thanks.
canban001	I'll take that, Mister Threepwood.
canban002	I might ask you the same question.
canban003	Instead, I'll just take that as evidence.
canban004	No.  This wouldn't be enough to convict him.
canban005	What a great idea, except no one knows where he is.
canban006	Bring him in, and I'll consider it.
canban007	But remember this:
canban008	Even if it fits, it only proves he was in the bank.
canban009	It doesn't tie him to the loot.
canban010	Yes.  But I can be swayed by the right evidence.  Now get outta here.
canban011	You're under arrest, Mister Threepwood.
canban012	Right!  Down to the jailhouse with you.
canban013	All right, you.  Didn't your mum ever explain that bank robbery isn't nice?
canban014	Right.  No-nosed bandit.  Or, perhaps it was the guy we caught red-handed.
canban015	You!
canban016	Although we haven't found the loot yet.
canban017	Detective work isn't my job.  If you want to clear your name, you've got a few things to do.
canban018	I need the perpetrator.
canban019	I need proof he was at the scene of the crime.
canban020	And I need proof that he committed the crime.
canban021	I'll ignore that, Threepwood.  Around here, we do things by the book.
canban022	Now, since this is your first offense, you'll be placed under house arrest.
canban023	No.  You are confined to Lucre Island™.  You are not permitted to leave until and unless you are cleared of the crime of bank robbery.
canban024	To make sure you don't leave, you are required to wear the Voodoo Anklet of Extreme Discomfort™.
canban025	Well, that wouldn't be the point, then would it?  It gets a lot more uncomfortable if you try to leave the island.
canhoj001	What's this?
canhoj002	It looks like a tiny screw.
canhoj003	Oh, you do, do you?  What makes you so sure, eh?
canhoj004	Quiet, you!
canhoj005	Well, then, perhaps we should give it a try.
canhoj006	Hmm.  It's a tiny screw.
canhoj007	Even if that were true, Mister Threepwood, there is no Pegnose on which to test your theory.
canhoj008	This is rather circumstantial, even for Lucre Island™.  Keep the screw and come back when you have something more tangible.
canhoj009	Without the actual prosthetic nose, we can't prove he was at the scene of the crime.
canhoj010	All this would prove is that somehow his nose screw wound up in a bag of loot from the bank.
canhoj011	His defense attorneys would have a field day with this.  Keep the screw and come back when you have something more tangible.
canhoj012	What's this?
canhoj013	That looks like Pegnose Pete!
canhoj014	He's right.  Do you have proof he did it?
canhoj015	Hmm.  Well, not exactly.
canhoj016	That would only prove that Pegnose here was at the scene of the crime.
canhoj017	It wouldn't prove he was the perpetrator.
canhoj018	To do that, you'd need to prove Pegnose had the loot in his possession.
canhoj019	So, I will not be administering justice in this case.
canhoj020	Then I will not be administering justice in this case.
canhoj021	Oh, Pete's not going anywhere.  He's wanted for plenty of other crimes.
canhoj022	Come back when you think you can prove what you claim.
canhoj023	Well, looks like you've thoroughly proven your innocence.  You're free to go.
canhoj024	Stay out of trouble.
canhoj025	Yes?
canhoj026	Who, Pegnose Pete?
canhoj027	Listen, if I had a monkey for every time some penny-ante crook tried to pin their criminal malfeasance on Pegnose Pete...
canhoj028	I'd have enough monkeys to work out a reasonable sequel to Hamlet by now.
canhoj029	No.
canhoj030	Quiet you!
canhoj031	Because, Mister Threepwood, it's just not Pegnose's style.
canhoj032	If Pegnose had robbed the bank, he would have snuck in under cover of darkness...
canhoj033	...used a clever series of weights and pulleys to open the vault...
canhoj034	...and would have absconded with the loot without leaving a trace of his presence.
canhoj035	Pegnose Pete would never simply enter a bank in the middle of the day, waving a pistol around like a common thug...it's beneath him.
canhoj036	Well, since you don't have an alibi, you'd have to turn the finger of blame towards the 'real' culprit.
canhoj037	Off the top of my head, I can think of three things that would do the job:
canhoj038	A) New evidence would have to surface, linking the so-called 'real' perpetrator to the crime,
canhoj039	2) The stolen bank loot would have to be recovered,
canhoj040	and Zed) The 'real' criminal would have to be caught and brought to justice.
canhoj041	I'll keep your cell warm.
canhoj042	<sigh>  Catch the 'real' perpetrator, recover the loot, and come up with evidence to back your story up.
canhoj043	Have you got any proof?
canhoj044	Listen, you, I've been tolerating your quixotic attempts to prove your 'innocence',
canhoj045	but if you start slandering the good names of respectable and powerful citizens like Mister Mandrill,
canhoj046	I'm going to have to seriously think about throwing you back in the clink.
canhoj047	Do I make myself clear?
canhoj048	Crystal.  Ulp.
canhoj049	Sorry, you're stuck on this island until your trial arrives,
canhoj050	... or until you manage to prove that you're (hah) innocent.
canhoj051	As soon as the judge returns.
canhoj052	He should be back within a few weeks, when his vacation's over.
canhoj053	Well, I guess you should have thought of that before you went and robbed that bank, now, shouldn't you?
canhoj054	Tell it to the judge.
canhoj055	That's why it's called the Voodoo Anklet of Extreme DISCOMFORT™.
canhoj056	Good.  That means it's working.
canhoj057	Are you trying to tell me something?
canhoj058	Forget it.  It's staying on.
canhoj059	If that one doesn't suit you, I could always get out the Voodoo Anklet of Excruciating Pain™.
canhoj060	What investigation?
canhoj061	You were caught red-handed; I'm just waiting for the judge.
canhoj062	Haven't you heard?  Justice is blind.
canhoj063	Quiet, you.
canhoj064	Quiet, you!
canhoj065	Well, we're all tickled pink that you've managed to capture Pegnose, seeing as how he's wanted for questioning in hundreds of Lucre Island™ thefts...
canhoj066	But, you haven't got any proof that he's the one who framed you, nor have you recovered the stolen loot.
canhoj067	But, you haven't proved he's responsible for robbing the bank.
canhoj068	But, you haven't recovered the stolen loot yet.
canhoj069	That doesn't mean YOU didn't steal it!
canhoj070	You still need to catch the 'real' thief and come up with some evidence to back it up.
canhoj071	Unfortunately, he's right.  You need some evidence to back up your story.
canhoj072	If I knew that, he'd be locked up right now.
canhoj073	Stay out of trouble.
canhoj074	He'll be released just about the same time you prove your (snort) innocence!
canhoj075	No.  Because he's wanted for approximately three hundred other crimes on Lucre Island™.
canluc001	Returning to the scene of the crime, are you?
canluc002	Right.  Bank's closed until my investigation is complete.
canluc003	So I don't want to see you going in there.
canluc004	I told you to stay out!
canluc005	Move along, people.  Nothing to see here.
canvau001	Come out with your hands up.
canvau002	We've got you surrounded!
canvau003	Your lawyers have negotiated a settlement.  Now drop everything and come out.
canvau004	Just send out the hostages and I'll see what I can do for you.
cascgs001	Crazy?  I'm not the one flagrantly violating the Rules and Regulations of Knuttin Atoll!
cascgs002	What's your name, sailor?
cascgs003	Make it quick, Threepwood.
cascgs004	I can't afford to let my eternal vigilance slip for even a minute.
cascgs005	Now, Mister Threepwood, what is your business on Knuttin Atoll?
cascgs006	Very good, Mister Threepwood.  Now, before I allow you to pass, do you have any questions?
cascgs007	My name is Ricardo Luigi Pierre M'Benga Chang Nehru O'Hara Casaba the Third.
cascgs008	But you can call me 'Admiral Casaba'.
cascgs009	For generations and throughout the world, the Casaba family has enforced the laws of the seas.
cascgs010	As a result, we've picked up an interesting and eclectic variety of in-laws.
cascgs011	I have been assigned the singular honor of guarding Ozzie Mandrill's commercial interests on Jambalaya Island™.
cascgs012	To that end, I have rounded up all of Jambalaya's scrofulous pirate trash and transported them to Knuttin Atoll,
cascgs013	Where they will remain until they become productive members of society.
cascgs014	Ah, only a handful.
cascgs015	It's deucedly slow, re-educating them one at a time.
cascgs016	Luckily, I hear that Mister Mandrill has some sort of secret plan to re-educate them all at once!
cascgs017	Mister Threepwood, it is MY experience that there are only two kinds of pirates:
cascgs018	Those who are committing acts of wanton savagery, and those PLANNING to commit acts of wanton savagery!
cascgs019	If you allow groups of the latter to congregate for any length of time, they inevitably transform into mobs of the former!
cascgs020	Of course.
cascgs021	It's the only way to stop their infernal plotting....
cascgs022	Even now, I can hear them, contemplating foul deeds against the good and wholesome citizens of Jambalaya...
cascgs023	Good lad.  Remember, I'm watching you!
casjam001	Fire!
casjam002	Get over here!
caskab001	Fire!
cdaall001	Don't touch that!
cdaall002	Hands off!
cdaall003	Touch it and die!
cdaall004	Leave it alone!
cdaall005	It would be harmful to your health!
cdaluc001	Ha ha.  Nice move, brainiac!
cdaluc002	You know the rules: you let go of a piece, it's a move!
cdaluc003	Rules are rules, tubbo.
cdaluc004	I'll tell you why.
cdaluc005	Because Lardbutt the Pirate here can't concentrate on the game for more than two minutes at a time.
cdaluc006	Yes, a wide variety of culinary interests, you mean.
cdaluc007	You never MOVE, you mean!
cdaluc008	And one that is not made any faster by your never-ending babbling.
cdaluc009	Grrr.
cdaluc010	Is he bringing lunch?
cdaluc011	Then I don't care, silly boy.
cdaluc012	Don't tell me you're gonna count THAT!
cdaluc013	You unbelievable jerk.
cdaluc014	Fine.  You wanna see a move?  Here's a move!
cdaluc015	You can't do that!
cdaluc016	Yes?
cdaluc017	Sure.
cdaluc018	But you might be waiting for a while.
cdaluc019	Because chess is a game that requires hours of intense concentration.
cdaluc020	No.
cdaluc021	Ah... it's difficult to say...
cdaluc022	It appears that Mister Santiago is employing a variant of the Barbarino Offense.
cdaluc023	If that's the case, then my Kaplan Maneuver should choke off his rooks.
cdaluc024	I've been chipping away at Mister Santiago's material via a subtle Yeltsin Stagger-Step Attack.
cdaluc025	But it looks as though he's undermining my efforts via a modified Kruschev Burial Defense.
cdaluc026	I don't know.  I haven't figured it out yet.
cdaluc027	Does he play chess?
cdaluc028	Then I don't care.
cdaluc029	Hmph.
cdaluc030	<gasp>  BRITTANY!?  WHERE!?
cdaluc031	Gainesian Pig!
cdaluc032	Lard Bucket!
cdaluc033	Bug Magnet!
cdaluc034	Sweat Factory!
cdaluc035	Falstaff Stand-In!
cdaluc036	Cheese Chomper!
chagme001	...choice.
chagme002	The name, Mister Threepwood, is Charles L. Charles.
chagme003	Well, that's the rub isn't it?  You've been declared dead.
chagme004	Who can say?  Ah, perhaps if you'd spent a little more time governing,
chagme005	and less time gallivanting all over the Tri-Island Area with your pet monkey,
chagme006	the good citizens of Mêlée wouldn't have come to the mistaken conclusion that you were pushing up the petunias.
chagme007	Oh, that.  When you 'died', the mansion became the property of the state.
chagme008	As a favor to me, the future Governor of Mêlée Island™, the town elders contracted a demolition firm--
chagme009	to destroy this outdated bourgeois symbol of the elitist piratocracy.
chagme010	Because the days of pirate princesses ruling from secluded mansions are over, my friend.
chagme011	Indeed they are, lad.  If the Mêlée Island™ of tomorrow is to prosper, it must be governed by a man of the people...
chagme012	...a man unafraid to mingle with the common folk...
chagme013	...a man who won't hide in a mansion guarded by vicious piranha poodles...
chagme014	Precisely.
chagme015	Well, I've got hands to kiss and babies to shake.  Ta!
chagme016	But you can call me the next Governor of Mêlée Island™!
chekit001	<Gasp>  Sacre foo!  What are you doing in mah keetchen?
chekit002	Oh, vichyssoise!  Why do you still molest mah keetchen?
chekit003	Out out out!
chekit004	Get outta mah keetchen!
chekit005	Get outta mah keetchen before I make you sushi du jour!

chelua003	<Gasp>  Oh mon dieu!  Not again!
chelua004	What in ze name of Eiffel?

chelua007	So help moi if I find out who deed thees!

chelua009	I do not understand.  Why do ze boats keep stopping?
chelua010	I feex it again!

chelua012	Sacre bleu!
chelua013	Oh-ho oui oui!
chelua014	Eh, you might as well take it.
chelua015	Eet ees of no use to me now.
chelua016	Zut alors!  You are not allowed back here!
chelua017	Close ze door before I whack you in ze noggin!
clagpt001	Well, THAT was a miserable journey.
clagpt002	And tourists.
clagpt003	Ohhh, I need a drink.
claluc001	What do you want?
claluc002	He's on shore leave.
claluc003	That figures.  He always gets in trouble when he's on shore leave.
claluc004	Someone has to stay and guard the ship while the Big Cheese repairs all the damage you inflicted on it.
claluc005	Like what?
claluc006	I thought you were looking for your wife's lawyers.
claluc007	This is how it starts, isn't it?
claluc008	First it'll be something quirky and fun, like a no-nosed pirate.
claluc009	Then, maybe, an innocent little voodoo spell used to, oh, I don't know, ward off vampire bats or something.
claluc010	And before you know it, LeChuck'll show up with his legions of undead goons, and POW! We'll all be stuck on Monkey Island™ again!
claluc011	--Sigh--
claluc012	I should've listened to Otis.
claluc013	No.
claluc014	What does it matter?
claluc015	We're all doomed to return to Monkey Island™.
claluc016	Do I really have a choice?
claluc017	Do I LOOK like I need any prostheses?
claluc018	Grrr.
claluc019	No, but keep it up and YOU might need some.
claluc020	I hate fishing.
claluc021	Walking sticks are for insecure wimps who can't keep their balance.
claluc022	Are you implying that Carla the Swordmaster stinks?
claluc023	Ooh!  Stop doing that!
claluc024	Are you sure you don't want just a small kick in the--
claluc025	Well, maybe you should.
claluc026	Whatever.
claluc027	Wha?
claluc028	Where!?
claluc029	What duzzit look like I'm doing?
claluc030	I'm drink...to forget.
claluc031	I forgot.
claluc032	THAT'S IT!
claluc033	I'm drinking to forget all that time I spent stranded on Monkey Island™!
claluc034	Th... thanks for meminding me...now I'll have to start drinking all over again.
claluc035	That dependz on the question, duzzinit?
claluc036	I'll tell ya what, Buygrush...Brushguy...Theepgood...
claluc037	I'll stay here 'n' keep my eye out for any pieces of the Ultimate Inshults that come by, okay?
claluc038	Alright then!  Barkeep!  More grog, ya biserable mastard!  Hick...
claluc039	It's horrible!
claluc040	The grog ish weaker than my pinky finger...
claluc041	They won't let me get into any shordfights...
claluc042	And all the chips have cottage cheese on 'em!
claluc043	Two reasons'sons:
claluc044	One, this is the only place a pirate can find a drink on this godforshaken family-friendly heckhole of an island, and... <hiccup>
claluc045	B, I think someone has stolen my legs.
claluc046	'Cause I can't feel 'em anymore.
claluc047	Aye-aye, Cap'n.
claluc048	Hey, that's a great idea!  Thanks for the shuggestion!
claluc049	And here I thought I was getting drunk.
claluc050	Ya know, maybe it's the fact that I've had 23 whole wheat potato grogs in the last hour...
claluc051	Hee hee... but you're cute when you talk like that.
claluc052	Iz what a trick question?
claluc053	Better not be.  Once was enough!
claluc054	Yeah, I was getting kind of bored.
clamel001	Is this some kind of joke?
clamel002	Heh!  We may be down-on-our luck pirates, but we're not stupid!  Come back when you've got a signed contract!
clamel003	Why are you showing us this?
clamel004	Wow, you actually got us a signed government contract.
clamel005	Hmmm...looks good...very nice...
clamel006	Hey, you're right!  We want a CUSHY government contract, with a desk!
clamel007	Wow, you actually got us a signed contract.
clamel008	Well... let's see...
clamel009	mmm hhmm... yes... ah, yes... good... uh huh.
clamel010	Not a clue.  But look, it says 'cushy' in the title!
clamel011	All right Threepwood, you've got yourself a crew.
clamel012	What is it now?
clamel013	Ahhhh!
clamel014	Oh... you, uh, startled us.
clamel015	Oh, ha, we have very common-looking faces.  Isn't that right?
clamel016	Drop it, Threepwood.
clamel017	I really don't think so.
clamel018	Like who?
clamel019	You'll have to excuse my friend...
clamel020	Our last adventure on the high seas ended...badly.
clamel021	We're in no hurry to return.
clamel022	Thanks, but NO.
clamel023	Guybrush, take a good look at Otis.
clamel024	That's what happened to him the LAST time we agreed to be part of your crew.
clamel025	Now, what in the name of Blackbeard's Dandruff could possibly convince us to join you in ANOTHER idiotic adventure?
clamel026	What incentive could we possibly have to risk our sanity in another of your mind-numbing quests?
clamel027	We'll meet you at the shipyards once you've got a ship...
clamel028	...(never thought I'd say THAT again)...
clamel029	Not if we see you first.
clamel030	What?
clamel031	We're still waiting for the treasure you promised us the LAST time.
clamel032	Oh, that's rich.
clamel033	Everyone knows that a mysterious foreign investor has bought up all the real estate around Booty Island™!
clamel034	Hmmm.  That sounds interesting.
clamel035	What kind of cushy government jobs are we talking about?
clamel036	We'd want contracts, of course.
clamel037	What was that?  Were you coming on to me?
clamel038	Then quit usin' your 'pickin' up wenches' voice.  It's creepy.
clamel039	Well, let us know when you think of one.
clamel040	We've never been to Phatt Island™.
clamel041	Yongler and Muntz?  Never heard of them.
clamel042	Not likely...neither of us can carry a tune.
clamel043	I don't think so--
clamel044	Uh... who?
clamel045	Let it go, Otis, the halfwit's recognized us.
clamel046	Do you have any idea how difficult it is to escape from Monkey Island™?
clamel047	Um, well, it's really difficult.
clamel048	The whole experience was very traumatizing.
clamel049	Yeah, well, 'sorry' doesn't feed the narwhals, buster.
clamel050	That's probably the case.
clamel051	He sold his house to a foreign investor!
clamel052	The investor challenged him to a round of Insult Gin Rummy, and BEAT HIM!
clamel053	The same story's been repeated dozens of times all over Mêlée Island™...
clamel054	This slimy investor strolls into a pirate's house or place of business...
clamel055	...challenges him to a game of Insult Something-Or-Another...
clamel056	...then humiliates them so badly that they have to cave in to his hostile takeovers!
clamel057	You mean Meathook?
clamel058	After we FINALLY got off Monkey Island™, Meathook renounced his pirate-y lifestyle, and returned to his true passion.
clamel059	Painting.
clamel060	You mean AFTER I finally managed to escape from Monkey Island™?
clamel061	Not in this lifetime.
clamel062	Anyhow, I've spent the last few years here on Mêlée Island™, re-establishing my Swordmaster credentials.
clamel063	Oh, it was...
clamel064	Until that Australian showed up.
clamel065	Yeah.  An Australian real estate developer.
clamel066	He challenged me to a round of Insult Sword Fighting.
clamel067	...badgered me into betting my house...
clamel068	...it was over so quickly...
clamel069	<sob>
clamel070	Now I wander the streets of Mêlée, Insult Sword Fighting for food.
clamel071	If we must.
clamel072	We may be hungry, but we're not THAT hungry.
clashi001	At least it doesn't smell like monkeys.
clashi002	Whatever.
clashi003	Don't make me slap you, Otis.
clashi004	If you get to go, I get to go.  SCUMM Bar here I come!
clashi005	Geez, we were just kidding.
clashi006	Jambalaya Island™?  'Kinda name is that?
clashi007	I'm right here!
clashi008	It's not fair!  Otis cheats!
clashi009	There's no such thing as an 'Illywhacker'!
clatri001	Whoaaaaaa!
clatri002	Shorten sail!
clatri003	Get your hands off me!
clatri004	Release the kraken!
clvplt001	Wh...who, me?
clvplt002	Oh, but I'm not--
clvplt003	Uh, what hand?
clvplt004	Ah, yeah!
clvplt005	Oh hohoho gosh me, a pirate?  Don't I wish now!  Pirates are the coolest!
clvplt006	I'm a vacationing pet shop clerk don't ya know?
clvplt007	<Laugh>  Nahhhh.
clvplt008	Everyone knows that Ozzie Mandrill's swept the island clean of you know those real scary pirates.
clvplt009	Well, thanks to him, I can indulge my passion for pirate memorabilia, if you must know, you know without the hassle of dealing with actual pirates haha!
clvplt010	Get out of here right now!
clvplt011	Real pirates have scars 'n' parrots 'n' peglegs -- you know stuff like that there.
clvplt012	You look more like one of the squeaky clean pirate 'performers' that Mandrill's hired to entertain the tourists.
clvplt013	Oah don't be stupid now.
clvplt014	The real Guybrush Threepwood is over seven feet tall...
clvplt015	...wears a hat dripping with the blood of his enemies...
clvplt016	...and he has the ghost of his favorite parrot perched on his shoulder there!  Right there ya!
clvplt017	Is that one of Planet Threepwood's toy giveaways?
clvplt018	Oh cripes, a quest!
clvplt019	This is just like my pirate role-playing games at home!
clvplt020	What does this Ultimate Insult look like?
clvplt021	Well maybe I can help ya.
clvplt022	B -bye now.
clvplt023	Ahhh.
clvplt024	That sounds like my 'Yellow Avenger' action figure back home in Osh Kosh.
clvplt026	Hmmm.
clvplt027	Haha nope.  I, ah, guess I don't have the Experience Points to come up with a clue.
clvplt028	A silver monkey head, eh?
clvplt029	Oh -- sounds like the Silver Monkey Mug they use for special occasions here at Planet Threepwood!
clvplt030	I'd risk half my Hit Points on it oh yeah!
clvplt031	Well fine!
cwdpla001	Poooolooooo!
cwdpla002	Pooooloooo!
cwdpla003	Marcoooooo!
cwdpla004	Poloooooo!
daigpt001	I got your fixin' right HERE, Cheese-boy!
daigpt002	Ah, speak for yourself, bub!
daigpt003	Repair THIS, you gimpy goat-sniffer!
daimdo001	What?!
daimdo002	Still posing as a pirate?
daimdo003	Damndest thing.
daimdo004	I crossed tacks with some old sea hag of a ship.
daimdo005	How was I supposed to know she was carryin' a cargo hold of voodoo root?
daimdo006	So a bunch of mojo crap fell off her decks, and I sailed right through it.  Next thing ya know, I'm talking.
daimdo007	Like you care anyway, squid for brains.
daimdo008	Perhaps you've seen me in your nightmares.
daimdo009	Yes you have.  Watch this.
daimdo010	I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD!!!!  WOO!
daimdo011	You'd be surly too if you were screwed to the stem of a ship.
daimdo012	This from a guy who can actually move his arms.
daimdo013	Wanna be my anchor?
daimdo014	Sure.  What of it?
daimdo015	Are you calling me a liar now?  I don't know, and I don't CARE about your Intimate Unsults!
daimdo016	I don't know what you're talking about.  But I don't think I like what you're implying, you son of a sea urchin.
daimdo017	Finally got that through your thick skull, did ya?
daimdo018	We're all lookin' for something, rat dander.
daimdo019	And you would make a lovely bride.
daimdo020	I can't help you, but I'll bet she's pretty blue now.
daimdo021	Just don't go in the harbor.  Some of us live in the water.
daimdo022	Oh, scrub off now, would ya?
daimdo023	Nope.
daimdo024	Really?
daimdo025	I've never heard of your stupid Ultramint Insole thing.
daimdo026	I was just yanking your chain!  Har!
daimdo027	Well then buzz off son.  You're blocking my view.
daimdo028	How's this for clarity:
daimdo029	Make like a jellyfish and dry up on the beach.
daimdo030	How long were you a bell hop before you got promoted?
daimdo031	Ho ho.  Very clever.
daimdo032	How 'bout dropping this subject, ToiletBrush Threepbowl.
daishi001	Who?  What?  Where?  Oh, cripes, not again.
daishi002	Couldn't just leave me alone, could you?
daishi003	Most pirates would be happy with a gorgeous, inanimate figurehead.
daishi004	But nooooo...you had to stick those accursed voodoo earrings into me!
daishi005	Well, here I am!  An enchanted, talking, ticked-off figurehead!  Am I everythin' you hoped for?
daishi006	Hey.  A talkin' monkey.
daishi007	Sez you.  I've been everywhere in this cesspool of a tropical paradise, and I've SEEN everything...
daishi008	...much more than some grog-lite swilling nobody like you.
daishi009	What is this compulsion you have to dress me up, you pantalooned freak?
daishi010	Oh, how sweet.  You remind me of the daughter your parents never had.
daishi011	Tryin' to stretch my earlobes?
daishi012	You know what else would look good on me?  YOUR blood on MY hands.
daishi013	Oh, do you need me to carry that big, heavy picture for you?
daishi014	Well, since I can't move my ARMS, I don't really have much choice, do I?
daishi015	Suits me fine...hey, who painted me pink?
deapop001	Yes?
deapop002	Welcome to the Palace of Prostheses!
deapop003	Home of the No-Detection, No-Infection, No-Rejection 30-Day Guarantee!
deapop004	<Sniff, sniff>  You smell new.  Who are you?
deapop005	I'm Dave.
deapop006	Around here they call me Deadeye Dave.
deapop007	I'm the Tri-Island Area's foremost expert in anatomical approximation.
deapop008	You don't smell so mighty to me.
deapop009	In fact, you smell kind of flowery...
deapop010	Phhht... Heck, I can smell your Lilacs-n-Lilies aftershave even through my stuffy nose.
deapop011	No you're not.
deapop012	No, Uncle Freddie smells more like lemon bean curd.
deapop013	Oh, it's been better.
deapop014	What?  Where'd you get a weird idea like that?
deapop015	Well you figured wrong.  'Australia'...what kind of a name is that, anyway?
deapop016	My monkey left me.
deapop017	What's he going to do, send me a postcard?
deapop018	Do I look blind?
deapop019	Of course I'm blind, ya lilac-scented pantywaist!
deapop020	Ah-ha-ha, don't give it a second thought.  My other senses more than compensate for my lack of sight.
deapop021	For example, I usually can identify my customers by their distinctive individual odors.  <Sniff>
deapop022	Usually, no problem.  <Sniff>  Today, though, my nose is stuffed up 'cause I've got, uh, a bit of a cold.
deapop023	So I can only recognize amplified odors...
deapop024	...like the lilac after shave you've generously applied to your face.
deapop025	Fortunately, my hearing's still sharper than a barge full of bunnies.
deapop026	Sharp enough, binky.
deapop027	Then you've come to the right place!
deapop028	What kinds of prostheses did you have in mind?
deapop029	<Sniff>  What kinds of gifts did you have in mind?
deapop030	Hmmm.
deapop031	Nope.  Never heard of him.
deapop032	Of course, if he's a thief he was probably using an alias.
deapop033	That's why I usually depend on my sense of smell...you can't fake a smell.
deapop034	Oh, that's too bad.
deapop035	Of course, even if I knew the pirate's name, it probably wouldn't matter.
deapop036	Without Pongo, I wouldn't be able to retrieve your pirate's file.
deapop037	Well, we certainly get a lot of those around here.
deapop038	N...no, no-nosed pirates.
deapop039	Oh my, yes.  You'd be amazed how often pirates lose their honkers.
deapop040	Does this pirate thief of yours have a name?
deapop041	<sniff, sniff>  Do you know his name yet?
deapop042	How would I know his alias?
deapop043	I only know my customers by their names and their smells.
deapop044	That makes one of us.
deapop045	Because, Pongo handled all my paperwork and deliveries.
deapop046	He was the only one who understood my back office's automated File-o-Matic filing system.
deapop047	Without him, I have no idea which orders go with which customers.  <Sniff>
deapop048	It's really upsetting my regular clientele.
deapop049	Despondent?  Over Pongo?  Oh, don't be silly.
deapop050	Are you daft?  I'd never let Pongo carve prostheses!
deapop051	No, I get around the shop just fine with or without Pongo.  Thank you very much.  <Sneeze>
deapop052	You're in luck... we've just received several baskets of SteadyLeg ivory pegs with rubber stoppers.
deapop053	Eh, they're twenty doubloons apiece.
deapop054	Ah... a traditionalist.
deapop055	Well, nothing says 'yo ho ho and a bottle of rum' quite like our QuickGut2000 line'a hooks.
deapop056	Today we're having a sale: Buy one hook for thirty doubloons, and get a replacement hook for free.
deapop057	<Sniff>  Well, if you're not too discriminating, there's a basket of slightly malformed redwood hands over there.  <Sniff>
deapop058	We're letting them go at five doubloons a pop.
deapop059	Sorry, we're fresh out.
deapop060	<Sniff>  It's shocking how quickly my regular customers blow through those things.  <Sneeze>
deapop061	Free?
deapop062	<Sneeze>  What do you think I'm running, a charity?
deapop063	--Sigh--
deapop064	Okay, you've appealed to my sense of generosity.
deapop065	<Sniff, sniff>  Here's what I'll do:  I'll let you have one of my untested...
deapop066	...unguaranteed...
deapop067	...unapproved...
deapop068	...experimental prosthetic devices.
deapop069	I'll let you choose...through a story.
deapop070	Humor me.
deapop071	Once upon a time, there was a pirate named...
deapop072	Can't get enough of experimental technology, huh?
deapop073	<Sniff>  Okay...
deapop074	Let me know if you need anything.  <Sniff>
deapop075	Jerry.
deapop076	Jerry had his EYE on a pirate princess named...
deapop077	Larry.
deapop078	Larry wanted to win the HAND of a fair maiden named...
deapop079	Harry.
deapop080	A PALM reader had told Harry that he was destined to marry a beautiful singer named...
deapop081	Mindy.
deapop082	Sadly, Mindy's FINGER was already wearing the engagement ring of a bounder named...
deapop083	Cindy.
deapop084	Unfortunately, Cindy's HAND had already been promised to a vile cad named...
deapop085	Wendy.
deapop086	Tragically, Wendy had already pledged her HEART to a jerk named...
deapop087	Well what?
deapop088	Oh, they all died of LIVER disorders in their early thirties.  You wouldn't believe how much grog those kids were drinking.
deapop089	Eventually she followed her HEART and married a quantum physicist from Azusa.  Who wants to marry a pirate, anyway?
deapop090	After many years of plotting, she became HEAD of all the families, and had them both whacked.
deapop091	Neither of them had the GUTS to go through with the wedding, so she turned her passion towards the stock market, where she lived happily ever after.
deapop092	She decided that she couldn't STOMACH the thought of being married to either of them, so she joined a convent.
deapop093	Realizing that beauty was only SKIN deep, she married the ugliest man in town.
deapop094	In the end, she ran off with a travelling prince who slipped a pair of glass slippers on her size-12 FEET.
deapop095	All three of them became the BUTT of a very naughty limerick.
deapop096	The End.
deapop097	I know.  Here's your free experimental prostheses.
deapop098	It's a Bumbleweeny M-Class Artificial Liver.
deapop099	They were recalled a few months back.  <Sneeze>
deapop100	Just the opposite; if they didn't get a constant supply of hard alcohol, they broke down.
deapop101	That's a top-of-the-line Pumpmeister Omega Brand Artificial Heart.
deapop102	<Sniff>  They were all the rage a couple years back...before the screws started rusting.
deapop103	That's a prototype for my own DeadeyeDeluxe Prosthetic Head.
deapop104	It's for pirates who've lost so many ears, eyes, and noses that they'd prefer to start all over with a brand new head.
deapop105	I plan on fixing that in my first patch release.
deapop106	That's a few dozen feet of Frinkle and Osterman's Artificial Guts.
deapop107	I know.  Those things always clog up on cold winter nights.  <Sniff, sniff>
deapop108	That's a factory model BileTastic Stom-Mech9000.
deapop109	If they ever can figure out how to keep the acid from leaking out, they'll sell millions.
deapop110	Don't worry...this unit's empty.
deapop111	THIS...is something special.
deapop112	It's a sample of my newly-created, Ultra-Stretchy, One-Size-Fits-All, Prosthetic Skin!
deapop113	With just a few square feet of this miracle substance, a pirate can replace all the skin he's lost during a lifetime of sword fighting,
deapop114	knife fighting, keelhauling, and the occasional flogging.
deapop115	<Sniff>  And it comes complete with a set of tiny hooks for easy attachment!
deapop116	These are a pair of Ace Studfinder Supersized Prosthetic Feet.
deapop117	They were designed for pirates with insecurities about the size of their... ya know, feet.
deapop118	Unfortunately, these things just made them look like Dutch clowns.
deapop119	This is a noble experiment that never quite worked.  <Sniff>
deapop120	A team of French proctologists decided to attack the problems faced by pirates who'd lost their butts.
deapop121	(Some had had their butts shot off in battle, others had worked their butts off, while still others could no longer find their butts with both hands and a flashlight.)
deapop122	After many years, they created this, the FauxButt3000.
deapop123	To everyone's surprise, it flopped.
deapop124	It turns out that people would rather have no butt at all than a phony butt.
deapop125	I did?  Well, I'm sorry, but I can only afford to hand out one of these per customer.
deapop126	Yeah, Fred.
deapop127	Ned, that's it.

deapop255	I dunno, lemee see...
deapop256	<Sniff> <sniff> <sniff>
deapop257	Nope.  I don't really smell much of anything in it.
deapop258	Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Visually challenged...
deapop259	Blah, well that only applies when my nose is clear.  <Sniff>
deapop260	I've kinda got a little bit of a cold and stuffed nose, so I can't smell much right now.
deapop261	If you really need to make use of my amazing odor-divining abilities, you're going to have to find a way to give me an amplified version of this smell.
deapop262	Just follow your nose!  <Sniff, sniff>
deapop263	Phew!  That's an all too familiar smell...
deapop264	Guess I can't complain though, since..
deapop265	..is my best customer.
deapop266	Aye...
deapop267	The man regularly buys prosthetic noses from me!
deapop268	Okay, too much information.
deapop269	<Sniff>  I have a strict rule of don't ask, don't smell.
deapop270	Oh yeah, sure.  He lives out past the Mystes O' Tyme Marshe.
deapop271	You can't get through there though without the directions he gave me.
deapop272	And it's filed away someplace in my File-o-Matic system.
deapop273	I can't.
deapop274	Pongo, my filing monkey, ran away a while back.  He was the only one who knew how to run the File-o-Matic.
deapop275	As a result, I have no idea how to retrieve the map.
deapop276	But if you can figure it out, feel free.
deapop277	The controls are right here.
deapop278	Or maybe you're just lucky...  <Sneeze>
deapop279	Wee-hew!  Stop spraying me with that!
deapop280	Like I told you, it belongs to...
deapop281	Dang, that's some weird smelling stuff you sprayed at me.
deapop282	It smells...
deapop283	...woody...
deapop284	...and fishy...
deapop285	...fishy...
deapop286	...and flowery...
deapop287	...flowery...
deapop288	...and swampy...
deapop289	...swampy...
deapop290	...and watery...
deapop291	...watery...
deapop292	...like stale air.
deapop293	When I say 'feel free' to use my file system, I do NOT mean 'feel free to steal my control box.'
deapop294	I know.  I ordered those from some fly-by-night overseas company, and now I'm stuck with 'em.
deapop295	I can't even give 'em away.
deapop296	I heard that!
deapop297	I hope you're plannin' to pay for that hand.  It ain't cheap.
deapop298	Well then, you'd best be puttin' it back then, eh tiger?
deapop299	Put it back, ya noisy scoundrel.
deapop300	Did I hear something?
diglaw001	Come in!
diglaw002	Hit and run dinghy accident?
diglaw003	...prestigious...
diglaw004	Governor's Mansion, you say.
diglaw005	But you can't be the Governor.
diglaw006	And people think lawyers have no sense of humor.
diglaw007	...and preposterous...
diglaw008	How much money do you think he has?
diglaw009	Is this alleged demolitionist wealthy?
diglaw010	Think outside the juror's box, my esteemed colleagues.
diglaw011	We could become the 'Official Lawyers for the Tri-Island Area™!'
diglaw012	Right.
diglaw013	Nope.
diglaw014	Right!
diglaw015	Legal issues can be quite complicated...
diglaw016	See the island...
diglaw017	It's a letter from Grandpa Marley.
diglaw018	We'll have to convince the court otherwise.
diglaw019	Let's ask for an injunction.
diglaw020	No, we really need to file for dismissal.
diglaw021	Habeas habeas habeas.
diglaw022	Two words, boys:  tough love.
diglaw023	Follow the money.
diglaw024	Who can we double-bill this time to?
diglaw025	No body, no foul.
diglaw026	Forget case law, we'll make it up.
diglaw027	We'll subpoena everyone on the island.
diglaw028	We'll just buy all the expert witnesses we need.
diglaw029	You can't handle the truth!
diglaw030	2 4 6 8, who wants to litigate!
diglaw031	Alibi, shmalibi.
diglaw032	They'll never know what hit them.
diglaw033	I'll give them personal injury!
diglaw034	Just object every chance you get.
diglaw035	Where are my briefs?
diglaw036	Is it time for lunch yet?
diglaw037	If we knew where the body was, we could order an exhumation.
diglaw038	He's got nothing of value to pay us with.
diglaw039	We're quite busy.
diglaw040	You mustn't rush the Gears of Justice, Mister Threepwood.
diglaw041	...webs of red tape to spin.
diglaw042	MUCH faster.
diglaw043	Make like a lobotomized monkey--
diglaw044	Have you gone to the bank--
diglaw045	Well, GO GET IT!
diglaw046	We could weave our legal webs faster--
diglaw047	Like a slack-jawed statue--
diglaw048	And retrieved the deed--
diglaw049	But what?
diglaw050	But we need one more document--
diglaw051	Outrageous!
diglaw052	Bwah-hah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
diglaw053	The Marley Mansion deed.
diglaw054	A lawsuit?
diglaw055	Intriguing
diglaw056	And why?
diglaw057	Oh, but sharks eat lawyers all the time...
diglaw058	A potential negligence litigation gold mine?
diglaw059	I don't get it.
diglaw060	Legally, the lawyer would have certain property rights...
diglaw061	Did the lawyers slap a lien on his ship?
diglaw062	(though legally inadmissible)
diglaw063	Carbunkle v. Heaven?
diglaw064	I suppose...
diglaw065	Well, the media would love it but... Canard is...
diglaw066	Broke.
diglaw067	You'd have better luck getting blood from a turnip.
diglaw068	Oh, I don't think so.
diglaw069	Too scary.
diglaw070	Before we can sue him.
diglaw071	Immoral!
doel002a	Ugh!
doel002b	Agh!
doel002c	Haugh.
doel003	Hmm. I hope the loyal citizens of Mêlée don't hurt themselves.  I mean, you know, all the pushing and shoving on the dock to see my, ... uh, well, our, return could be dangerous.  Make sure this one stays on top.

doel012	No, you adorable numbskull, something's gone horribly wrong while I've been away.  N...Nothing else can explain...
doel016	Timmy, is something wrong?
doel019	There's been an outbreak of scurvy?
doel022	There's trouble at the Governor's Mansion?!?!  Let's go!

dogb002e	Aieee, eh.

dogb009	Maybe everyone went to bed early?
dogb011	We can spend another three months honeymooning?
dogb013	Hey!!!  It's Timmy the Monkey!  How are ya, boy?
dogb014	Either his litter box is full, or he's trying to tell us something.  What is it, boy?
dogb018	Free grog at the SCUMM Bar?
dogb020	You won 74 bucks playing Bingo but lost it all playing banana futures?
dogb021	There's trouble at the Governor's Mansion?!?!  Let's go!

e1cr011	Boo!  Hiss!  Stupid, are we?
e1cr011a	Boo!  Hiss!  Stupid, are we?
e1el001	...and, if re-elected, I promise that Mêlée Island™ will remain a place where men and women can be proud of their pirate traditions and lifestyle!
e1el003	Ex...Excuse me?
e1el005	And?
e1el007	What. Economic stability and personal liberty aren't enough for you people?
e1el010	S...Stop...St...Stop it! Y...Y...You can't be stupid enough to believe that Charles is just gonna give you free grog and good times, can you!?

e1hk004	Charles L. Charles is promising us good times and free grog!
e1hk006	Well, what are you going to give us?
e1hk008	If it's all the same to you, we'd prefer free grog.
e2ch002	My opponent is right: I am a newcomer to these islands.  And it's true that my experience in affairs of state is minimal at best.  But it doesn't take a seventh-generation pirate princess to see that Mêlée Island™ needs more than a part-time status quo Governor...a Governor who can't even promise her citizens...Good Times and Free Grog!

eddpla002	You wish.  In this round of dives, YOU will go first, and De Pollo will try to match your dive.
eddpla003	Okay, everyone, settle down.  The first round has ended in a tie...again.  We'll have to run another tiebreaker.
eddpla004	The tiebreaker only delayed the inevitable, folks...Marco de Pollo is the winner!

eddpla012	That's all?  Really?
eddpla013	Deal.  It won't do ya any good, though.
eddpla014	De Pollo's too good to be beaten by a flat-headed loser like you.
eddpla015	Is that a bribe?  If so, it's a pretty insulting one.
eddpla016	Look, kid, I'm already being bribed and blackmailed.  Don't push your luck.
eddpla017	Whatever.
eddpla018	Actually, it's more like a free-for-all than a contest.
eddpla019	You and dozens of other gold-hunting wannabes.
eddpla020	Don't act so shocked; you'd have to be a palsy-ridden grandmother to fail.
eddpla021	Are you kidding?
eddpla022	Look, junior, we're diving judges.  We know as much about voodoo as you do about astrophysics.
eddpla023	Nope.
eddpla024	What?
eddpla025	It SUCKED.
eddpla026	No.
eddpla027	Nothing, ya craven blackmailer.
eddpla028	Tell someone who cares, like Marco de Pollo over there.
eddpla029	You've obviously mistaken me for someone who gives a farthing.
eddpla030	Look, kid, it's nothing personal.
eddpla031	It's just that I've got an expensive red-headed wife, two expensive red-headed kids, and an expensive red-headed dog to feed, ya follow?
eddpla032	Then let me spell it out for ya:
eddpla033	Mister Mandrill pays me a LOT of money to make sure that Mister de Pollo ALWAYS wins.
eddpla034	I appreciate the sentiment, junior,
eddpla035	but it's obvious that you don't have two shillings to rub together,
eddpla036	much less the kind of dough it takes to keep my red-headed wife living in the manner to which she's accustomed.
eddpla037	Whatever.
eddpla038	Nope.
eddpla039	Why don't you quit bothering me and go dive?
eddpla040	Yes, I'm already aware of the fact that you're blackmailing me.
eddpla041	Is that a bribe?  If so, it's a pretty insulting one.
eddpla042	What's the matter?  Having second thoughts?
eddpla043	I hope you're planning on heading back up to the plank, soon, or you'll be disqualified.
eddpla044	Get back up there or you're disqualified!
eddpla045	That's it!  You're disqualified!
eddpla046	Why are you showing me this?
eddpla047	Yes, yes, you're a certified diver, that's great.
eddpla048	Marco de Pollo is about to attempt a...
eddpla049	Keelhaul
eddpla050	Rum Barrel
eddpla051	Spinning Swordsman
eddpla052	Alpha Monkey
eddpla053	combination.
eddpla054	Now Marco de Pollo will attempt to beat Guybrush Threepwood's dive.
eddpla055	Let's give him complete silence for this dive.
eddpla056	Of course you can, boyo.
eddpla057	Aye.  He's off filming an infomercial.
el1all001	Guybrush!  What did I tell you about drinking grog!?
el1all002	Guybrush Ulysses Threepwood!
el1gme001	Ahhh!
el1gme002	You can't knock down the Governor's Mansion without approval from the Governor!
el1gme003	But I am the Governor!
el1gme004	Do I look dead to you?
el1gme005	Then cease and desist your boulder-flinging immediately!
el1gme006	Something's rotten on Mêlée Island™.
el1gme007	I've got a plan.
el1gme008	Uh!  Guybrush!
el1gme009	I'm going down to city hall to see about getting declared un-dead.
el1gme010	In the meantime, I need you to do two things for me.
el1gme011	Maybe later.  First, I want you to put a stop to this insane boulder-flinging.
el1gme012	Second, I want you to go to Lucre Island™.  Talk to my grandpa's lawyers.
el1gme013	They might know how to help us fight city hall.
el1gme014	Not as much as they'll hate talking to you, dear.
el1gme015	Well, I've got a resurrection to perform!
el1gme016	Be good, dear!
el1gme017	And don't forget:  Stop the Catapult.  Go to Lucre Island™.
el1gme018	Guess what?  I'm still dead!
el1gme019	We've been gone so long, they didn't think I was coming back,
el1gme020	so those numbskulls at city hall declared me dead at sea.
el1gme021	No.  Then they decided to sell all my belongings and destroy the mansion.
el1gme022	An... and the worst part is they've ordered a new election for the office of Governor.
el1gme023	So far there's only one candidate, and you know the old slogan:
el1gme024	When there's only one candidate, there's only one...
el1gme025	But you can call me the next Governor of Mêlée Island™!
el1gme026	You can't be the governor!  I'm the governor, and it's a lifetime term.
el1gme027	So I've heard.  How did THAT happen?
el1gme028	Okay, we get it: you're running for governor.  But why destroy my mansion?
el1gme029	A man like you?
el1gme030	There's something fishy about that guy.
el1gme031	I've got another plan.
el1gme032	I'm going back to City Hall to run against Charles!
el1gme033	Go to Lucre Island™ to talk to the family lawyers.
el1gme034	Yes dearest, I know, but with that demolition order hanging over the mansion, another catapult could come at any moment!
el1gme035	We need the kind of restraining order that only my family lawyers can provide!
el1gme036	Guybrush, love of my life, I'm a politician.  Let me do what I do best; I'll let you do what you do best.
el1gme037	Sailing around the Tri-Island Area on seemingly pointless errands.
el1gme038	Oh, I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
el1gme039	Oh oh.  What I meant to say was, 'Venturing into Troubled Waters on Dangerous Quests.'
el1gme040	Okay, I'm off to start my campaign.  Don't spend too much time on Lucre Island™, dearest!
el1gmi001	Dearest, I thought we agreed that you wouldn't be spreading your messy inventory over our nice, clean floor.
el1gmi002	I already signed this.
el1gmi003	Another contract?
el1gmi004	Well, so much for my status as a reform candidate.
el1gmi005	What's this for?
el1gmi006	Darling, can't you just use your blinding charisma to cajole them into joining you?
el1gmi007	Oh, all right, let me sign it.
el1gmi008	Let me guess:  Another government bribe.
el1gmi009	When you get back from Lucre Island™, we're going to have a long talk about civic ethics.
el1gmi010	And?
el1gmi011	Bribes?
el1gmi012	Fine.  Give me the contract.
el1gmi013	Ha!  Good guess.
el1gmi014	Oh, that's so sweet, Guybrush.  Now get back to work.
el1gmi015	Don't make me get out your baby pictures...
el1gmi016	No, but I have some of you crying after you got smacked in the head...
el1gmi017	Or maybe the clock hasn't been wound in three months.
el1gmi018	Ah ah.  Don't even THINK about touching the china, Guybrush.
el1gmi019	I LIKE that lamp!
el1gmi020	Of course you did, dear.
el1gmi021	What are you doing here, Guybrush?
el1gmi022	Have you been drinking grog again?
el1gmi023	Honey, please pay attention this time.
el1gmi024	I always knew you had it in you to destroy heavy machinery, my chaotic little pet.
el1gmi025	Unfortunately, that's only a stopgap measure.  We have to find a more permanent solution.
el1gmi026	What kind of trouble?
el1gmi027	Ask nice, and don't make any ridiculous promises.
el1gmi028	I'll leave the crew selection to you, my dearest, and you can leave the campaign management to me.
el1gmi029	Is there anything else?
el1gmi030	I really don't have time to help you with that.
el1gmi031	Why?
el1gmi032	Well, I'd like to help, sweetheart, but we're kind of strapped for cash right now.
el1gmi033	Besides, what happened to your monthly allowance?
el1gmi034	Well then, I'm sorry my dear, it's time you learned an important lesson about budgeting.
el1gmi035	Not until you learn how to spend your money responsibly.
el1gmi036	Thanks.
el1gmi037	Excuse me, dear, I... I have some important business to attend to.
el1gmi038	Grog makes you forgetful.
el1gmi039	Now pay attention.
el1gmi040	Good.
el1gmi041	There's a time and a place for everything, Guybrush.
el1gmi042	Now, while I concentrate on running for reelection, you're going to get yourself to Lucre Island™.
el1gmi043	And once there, you will visit with the Marley family lawyers.
el1gmi044	And you'll work with them to find a legal way of saving the mansion from Charles' demolition goon.
el1gmi045	Got it?
el1gmi046	Try not to forget, okay?
el1gmi047	Now, Guybrush, please go so I can get back to my campaign.
el1gmi048	But I like living here.
el1gmi049	Besides, it's probably just as messed up everywhere else.
el1gmi050	You mean, like Mêlée dot com?
el1gmi051	That's stealing, even for pirates.
el1gmi052	That's not very civilized, honey bear.
el1gmi053	Besides, I wouldn't want you to get hurt.  I'm too young to be a widow.
el1gmi054	Thanks for trying to help, Guybrush, but uh, I think we need to stick to the current plan.
el1gmi055	We live on an island, Guybrush.  There ought to be a ship around here somewhere.
el1gmi056	I don't think you're applying yourself to the task.
el1gmi057	Well, then get out there and find a ship!
el1gmi058	Oh, oh wait.
el1gmi059	Here.  Take this.  It should give you an air of authority.
el1gmi060	It's the official Gubernatorial Symbol of Mêlée Island™.
el1gmi061	It conveys the authority of the office of governor.
el1gmi062	It also gets the holder into some pretty great parties, hahaha.  Ahem
el1gmi063	Yes, well all the same, I... I think you'd better take it.
el1gmi064	Just give it back the minute you return from Lucre Island™.
el1gmi065	Glad to hear it.
el1gmi066	.
el1gmi067	Yes?
el1gmi068	This is no time for snack foods, Guybrush.
el1mel001	<Sigh>  What is it now, Guybrush?
el1mel002	Guybrush!
el1mel003	Uh, stop that catapult from destroying our home, then sail to Lucre Island™, remember?!
el1mel004	Guybrush!  What are you doing here?
el1mel005	Quit fooling around, and stop that catapult!
el1mel006	Guybrush!
el1mel007	Just what do you think you're doing?
el1mel008	Ah, ah, ah... get back here.
el1mel009	Now, what did I tell you about the Gubernatorial Symbol?
el1mel010	What's that behind your back?
el1mel011	Come on, show it to me.
el1mel012	Heh, heh, ya... I'd probably be more surprised at what you thought were great goodies.
el1mel013	Sure you do.
el1mel014	Oh come on.  I let you take the ship out by yourself, didn't I?
el1mel015	That's right.
el1mel016	Now give it back.
el1mel017	Ahem.
el1mel018	Aren't you forgetting something?
el1mel019	Cute.
el1mel020	You're welcome.
el1mel021	Wow, sounds like heaven.
el1mel022	No, you forgot to give the Gubernatorial Symbol back to me.
el1mel023	What is it, dear?  I'm kind of busy right now.
el1mel024	Now that you know what the Ultimate Insult is, you need to find it, so that it can be safely disposed of.
el1mel025	Dearest, I THOUGHT we agreed that you'd go talk to the Voodoo Lady.
el1mel026	Aaaaah, knowing LeChuck, it's probably some ludicrously powerful voodoo thingamabob.
el1mel027	All the more reason you should visit the Voodoo Lady.
el1mel028	Well, what did she say?
el1mel029	Yikes!  Huh!  No wonder a couple of warped cretins like LeChuck and Ozzie want to get their hands on it.
el1mel030	Only if you're going to tell me that it's been found and destroyed.
el1mel031	Then I don't want to hear it.
el1mel032	Really?  Let me see!
el1mel033	Ugh, what was my grandfather thinking?
el1mel034	These earrings, they're way too big, and they're made of wood!
el1mel035	The necklace is okay, I guess, but this pen looks like it was stolen from a bank!
el1mel036	No thanks.
el1mel037	Put them to good use finding the Ultimate Insult...
el1mel038	All they do for me is remind me of Grandpa... (sniff)
el1mel039	Badly, and NO.
el1mel040	Why?
el1mel041	You'll get your allowance on the first of next month, Guybrush, and no sooner.
el1mel042	And don't pout.
el1mel043	Sorry, dearest, we need all our cash to fund my re-election campaign.
el1mel044	Try not to get killed and/or cursed, dear.
el1mel045	Good afternoon, citizen.  I'm Mêlée Island™ Governor Elaine Marley, and I'm running for re-election.
el1mel046	It has recently come to my attention that my opponent, Charles L. Charles,
el1mel047	is none other than the Demon Zombie Ghost Pirate LeChuck.
el1mel048	Does Mêlée really want an agent of the Undead Legions of Heck governing its fiscal policy?  I think not!
el1mel049	Thank you for your time, citizen, and remember: vote for Elaine Marley on election day.
el1mel050	About what?
el1mel051	I don't know.
el1mel052	I don't know.
el1mel053	I don't know.
el1mel054	I know I'm going to regret asking this, but what is it?
el1mel055	That's not very heroic, dear.
el1mel056	I've got a better idea.
el1mel057	Hmmm.  That's close, but I've got a better idea.
el1mel058	Riiight, right right.  Well, now here's MY plan:
el1mel059	I'll redouble my efforts to keep LeChuck out of the Governor's Mansion.
el1mel060	(which should be a lot easier now that I know he's really an evil undead demon from Heck.)
el1mel061	In the meantime, why don't you do everything you can to stop Ozzie and LeChuck from getting their hands on the Ultimate Insult, whatever that is.
el1mel062	If I were you, honey, I'd talk to the Voodoo Lady.  She always seems to know about these things.
el1mel063	Have fun fighting the bad guys, schnookums!
epel002	Grandpa!
epel013	Grandfather, please. I can't stand being the Governor. It's no way for a pirate to live. Guybrush and I need to be on the open seas, waving our swords, swashing our buckles! We're too young to become career bureaucrats.
epel015	Every month!
epel019	Hey, you're a talking monkey!
epel021	Well. Thank you, noble Jojo, for helping to make the seas once again safe for pirates everywhere.
epel025	Timmy!
epel031	Guybrush, now that Grandpa's Governor again, we're free!  Heh. We can go wherever and do whatever we want!
epgb001	Elaine!
epgb004	Uh. Jojo!
epgb007	Well, for starters, you could put on some pants.
epgb009	Also...
epgb011	Would you please be the Governor of Mêlée Island™ again?
epgb017	Um. He. We'll see what we can do. Huh.
epgb020	Oh. Elaine, I'd like you to meet Jojo Jr., the Monkey Prince of Monkey Island™.
epgb023	Where will you go?
epgb028	Good-bye, Jojo! We'll never forget you!
epgb029	Of course, I'll never forget him.  I mean, he's a talking monkey!  How creepy is that?
epgb030	Well, that's it. We've saved the mansion, found your grandfather, and once again made the Caribbean safe for bloodthirsty, grog-swilling reprobates. Whew! Who knew married life would be so much fun?
epgb032	Um. Elaine?  Timmy?  Herman?  Mommy?  George? Hey guys! I'm stuck down here! Wally? Lindy? Uh. Oh. It's a long way down. Uh. Murray? Uh. Sean? Mike? Oh. Jar Jar?
ephn003	Aaah. Aaah. Darling!
ephn006	Guybrush, how can I ever thank you for reuniting me with my granddaughter?
ephn008	He he he he he! Consider it done!
ephn010	Yes?
ephn012	Uh-uh.  No way, no how.  I hated being Governor.  Why do you think I went all the way to Australia in the first place?  For the cuisine?
ephn014	Well. He he he. All right....but you'd better come by to visit!
ephn016	And I want to start seeing some pirate great-grandchildren!
ephn034	Hmm. Huh! I wonder if I could pay someone to whack me on the head with an accordion. He he he he he. Huh. He. Hmm.
epjj005	Don't even think about it, pink boy!
epjj018	And so the circle of life continues.
epjj022	It was my pleasure, Mrs. Threepwood.  But now, I must be going.  Somewhere out there, my monkey brothers and I have a destiny to fulfill.
epjj024	I don't really know. I hear that Martha's Vineyard is nice this time of year. But first, we have a crew member who wants to disembark.
epjj027	Farewell, everyone!
eplc033	Mwah-hah-hah!  They think they're rid of me, but no one can defeat LeChuck!  My unquenchable evil is indestructible, immortal, eternal, im-what's that sound? Ow!
epti026	Oop Ak!
epti031a	Ooo ooo ooo.
eyel007	This is horrible.  LeChuck has enslaved my people!  It's a good thing my grandfather isn't alive to see this.  But why is he making them build that statue?  What does that have to do with the Ultimate Insult?  What's happened to Guybrush?  What's that smell?
eyel007a	This is horrible.  LeChuck has enslaved my people!
eyel007b	It's a good thing my grandfather isn't alive to see this.
eyel007c	Why is he making them build that statue?
eyel007d	What does this have to do with the Ultimate Insult?
eyel007e	What's happened to Guybrush?  What's that smell?
eyel009	Obviously not hard enough.  You must be Pegnose Pete.
eyel011	Gee, You know I'd like to, but I have to wash my hair for the next seven years.
eyel013	Drat.
eyp1001	Uuuugh....huuuugh. Ha! Good Times, Free Grog,' my pockmarked fanny! You should all be ashamed of yourselves!
eyp1001a	Uuuugh....huuuugh. Ha! Good Times, Free Grog,' my pockmarked fanny!
eyp1001b	You should all be ashamed of yourselves!
eyp1004	Well, if NONE of us voted for him, then why is he the Governor?  And why are we being forced to build this colossal commemorative statue of him in the center of town?
eyp1004a	Well, if NONE of us voted for him, then why is he the Governor?
eyp1004b	And why are we being forced to build this
eyp1004c	colossal commemorative statue of him in the center of town?
eyp2002	Don't be lookin' at me, ye mangy mongrel.  I voted for Elaine, I did!
eyp2005	Ah, shaddup!
eyp3000a	Aaaagh....uuuugh.
eyp3000b	Uuuugh....huuuugh.
eyp3003	Well, I certainly didn't vote for that bilge rat LeChuck!
eyp3006	Ah, shaddup!
eypp008	Arrr, Ex-Governor Marley.  You're a hard woman to find, you know that?
eypp010	Aye.  The Governor and Mister Mandrill have a few questions they'd like to ask you.
eypp010a	Aye.
eypp010b	The Governor and Mister Mandrill have a few questions they'd like to ask you.
eypp012	I really must insist.
figb006	Ewwwwww...... Yeaaaaaah..... Ewwwwwww......
fihn004	Ewwwwww...... Yeaaaaaah..... Ewwwwwww......
fijj005	Ewwwwww...... Yeaaaaaah..... Ewwwwwww......
fioz001	Hey, what's going on here?
fioz002	LeChuck, you colossal idiot, I order you to cease this at once!
fioz003	Hey! Wait a minute...ya can't do this to me...I'm Ozzie Mandrill...I'm the future of the Caribbean...I command...stop...don't...Aaiiiiiiieeeeeee!
fioz003a	Hey! Wait a minute...ya can't do this to me...I'm Ozzie Mandrill...
fioz003b	I'm the future of the Caribbean...I command...stop...don't...Aaiiiiiiieeeeeee!
frehos001	Welcome, young man.  Feel free to look around.
frehos002	Welcome back.  Let me know if you need any assistance.
frehos003	What in tarnation are you doing, son?
frehos004	Is that what they call it these days?
frehos005	Well, be quick about it.
frehos006	I wouldn't want any women folk to see that.
frehos007	To the untrained eye, they might.
frehos008	Those sticks didn't pass our rigid quality assurance process.
frehos009	They're probably fine for the non-discriminating type of consumer.
frehos010	But those sticks wouldn't pass the muster for our high-end buyers.
frehos011	No need to make a racket ringing that bell, I'm right here!
frehos012	Besides, it's not yours to take, sonny.
frehos013	The glue is still drying on that cane.
frehos014	Please don't pick it up.
frehos015	Ayup.
frehos016	Yup.
frehos017	Freddie's my name.
frehos018	Been makin' sticks since you were no bigger than a toenail on a June bug, ha ha ha.
frehos019	It's right over here, Mister Mandrill.
frehos020	A brand new cane, hand-carved to the exact specifications of your previous stick.
frehos021	I, uh, take it that you'll be putting this on your tab, Mister Mandrill?
frehos022	Y'know, if I weren't a peaceable sort, I'd whack that gentleman over the head with one of my sticks.
frehos023	And I wouldn't stop whacking until his brains leaked all over my rustic, hand-polished, hardwood floor, ha ha ha!
frehos024	Oh, sure is Mister Mandrill.
frehos025	It's right... eh, over on that bench there.
frehos026	Yes sir.  Always a pleasure, Mister Mandrill.
frehos027	So you are.
frehos028	Most people 'round here call me 'Freddie.'
frehos029	Which is a sensible thing to do, considerin' that it's my name 'n' all.
frehos030	I carve walking sticks.
frehos031	Well, under normal circumstances, I might agree with that sentiment.
frehos032	But lately, Lucre Island™'s been experiencing an influx of tourists, gawkers, and other assorted outsiders.
frehos033	They're always more than eager to purchase my 'authentic pirate walking sticks'...at a reasonable markup, of course.
frehos034	Besides which, I can always depend on Mister Mandrill to break a few dozen sticks a week.
frehos035	He's been single-handedly keeping me in business for months.
frehos036	Well now, I wouldn't exactly call it 'booming,' but it's putting food on the table.
frehos037	And if Mister Mandrill ever pays off his tab, I can retire!
frehos038	Well now, in order to choose the right stick, we'll need to know a little about your walking stick needs.
frehos039	Where do you expect to be doin' most of your walking?
frehos040	Well then, let's find a good one for ya.
frehos041	Well now...
frehos042	THAT sounds a lot like Pegnose Pete.
frehos043	What would you like to know about him?
frehos044	What would you like to know?
frehos045	You mean Mister Mandrill?
frehos046	Well, for one thing, he's rich.
frehos047	If he ever pays off his tab, I'll be able to retire.
frehos048	For another thing, he's a steady customer.
frehos049	Barely a day goes by when he doesn't break his walking stick in a fit of rage, and demand a new one.
frehos050	For a third thing, he's not too bright.  I've been 'carving new sticks' for him for months,
frehos051	And he's never noticed that I just keep gluing the same stick back together over and over again.
frehos052	Heh, heh, heh.
frehos053	No sir, can't think of a thing.
frehos054	Be seein' ya.
frehos055	Pegnose?
frehos056	He's the greatest pirate thief on Lucre Island™!
frehos057	No one's come within a ship's broadside of putting him in leg irons, ayup.
frehos058	But I came close, once.
frehos059	Yes!
frehos060	It happened one dark and foggy night, many years ago...
frehos061	... I was out testin' out one of my new walking stick models...
frehos062	...the WD-32...
frehos063	...(it has a real fancy lookin' wood duck engraved in the handle)...
frehos064	...and he tried to mug me!
frehos065	Well, I wasn't gonna stand for that!
frehos066	I raised my cane up to give him a good whack on the noggin, you betcha!
frehos067	And he ran away!
frehos068	I didn't even get a chance to swing!
frehos069	I guess he knows better than to mess with old Freddie, ayup.
frehos070	You got sticks in your ears, son?
frehos071	He's Lucre Island™'s uncatchable pirate thief.
frehos072	You can't.
frehos073	No one knows where Pegnose's hideout is.
frehos074	Oh, sure, there're some rumors of him living in the middle of the treacherous Mystes O' Tyme Marshe...
frehos075	But frankly, I don't believe a human being can get there from here.
frehos076	I said that you couldn't.
frehos077	That's something of a mystery.
frehos078	Most folk 'round these parts would tell you, it was nibbled off by a duck.
frehos079	Personally, I don't believe it.
frehos080	Well sir, it's been my experience that ducks have exceptionally tiny teeth.
frehos081	It'd take a long time for a duck, even a particularly nasty duck, to nibble off a man's nose.
frehos082	I can't imagine a man letting a duck peck away at his nose for hours on end without seeking medical help.
frehos083	Yeah, I suppose it could have happened that way.
frehos084	I just find it highly irregular.
frehos085	I have no idea.
frehos086	Makes no nevermind to me, junior.
frehos087	Hmm, a beachcomber.
frehos088	And how many people would you expectin' to be walkin' with?
frehos089	Ah, the adventurous type!
frehos090	Oh, I see.
frehos091	Hmph.
frehos092	Perhaps you should talk to me again when you're more serious about walking sticks.
frehos093	I sorta figured that might be the case.
frehos094	How long will ya be walkin', on average?
frehos095	Whatever you say, sir.
frehos096	That's probably wise.
frehos097	Whenever you're ready.
frehos098	You should try to pace yourself a little better.
frehos099	Hmmm.  I see.
frehos100	Very good.
frehos101	Will you be parting any seas along the way?
frehos102	Well, then, taking all your answers into consideration...
frehos103	...not to mention the numerous personal observations I've made of your movements...
frehos104	I believe that the perfect walking stick for you would be... the Veeblefester9000 RainForest Deluxe.
frehos105	As luck would have it, we've got dozens of them in stock.
frehos106	See?  It MUST be the stick for you!
frehos107	Well, I really can't recommend a walking stick until I know how long you expect to use it.
gmgb001	Phew. Oops. I'd better get out of here before someone finds out what I did.
gmgb005	Sure.
gmgb006	Ride? Uh. What do you mean by that?
gmgb008	Giant Monkey Robot?  Hmm. Are you sure you have all of your memory back?  Maybe I should hit you again...
gmgb008a	Giant Monkey Robot?  Hmm. Are you sure you have all of your memory back?
gmgb008b	Maybe I should hit you again...
gmhn002	Relax there, son.
gmhn003	We're going for a little ride.
gmhn007	We're taking this Giant Monkey Robot to Mêlée Island™ to rescue my granddaughter!
gmhn007a	We're taking this Giant Monkey Robot to Mêlée Island™
gmhn007b	to rescue my granddaughter!
gmjj004	Pull that lever there, would ya?
googme001	What does it look like I'm doing, fancy pants?
googme002	I'm knocking down the Governor's Mansion.
googme003	The Governor's dead, ma'am.
googme004	'Twas the marriage that kilt her, they say.
googme005	Uh, no ma'am.
googme006	Sorry, Governor, I'm under contract.
googme007	I'm legally obligated to destroy your mansion with this here catapult.
googme008	Sounds like the honeymoon's over.
googme009	What the--?
googme010	Yiiiiiiiikes!
googme011	Ha!
googme012	I can't believe you did that.
googme013	Do you have any idea what those things cost?  They don't grow on trees, ya know.
googme014	That's me.
googme015	Mmm... that was good.
googme016	HEY!  What are you doing over here?!  BEAT IT!

googme037	FIRE!
googme038	HEY!
googme039	Get away from there, before I pop ya one on the head, capeeche?!
googme040	Good.  Now stay over there, pencil-neck!
googme041	AAAAAAHHHH!
googme042	HEY!  Whaddya think you're doing?!
googme043	You totally messed up my catapult!
googme044	Whatcha tryin' to do ta me?  You're killin' me over here!
googme045	Well, I guess I'm going to have to start over at my calibration cactus over there.
googme046	Get outta my way!
googme047	There, it's recalibrated to the cactus.  Let's try it.
googme048	Really?  Thanks!  I really appreciate this.
googme049	I could...
googme050	But I won't.  Now leave me alone for a minute while I eat these...
googme051	Sure!  Wow, remind me to thank you later.
googme052	Sorry, kid.  No can do.  Now let me eat this in peace.
googme053	Who you callin' scrawny, pencil-neck?
googme054	What?
googme055	Sorry 'bout that, kid, but I'm under contract.
googme056	Permanently?  Eh, some kind of restraining order, I guess.  You'd need some fancy lawyers for that.
googme057	Well, the union gives us liberal snack breaks during the day.
googme058	But I don't have any snacks.
googme059	Ya know, I don't rightly know.
googme060	They're supposed to be targeting numbers or something, but I'll be danged if I can figure them out.
googme061	All I know is how to hit that cactus...I'm trying to extrapolate from there.
googme062	Nah.  I only do that when I think the catapult's out of alignment.
googme063	I wouldn't want to waste one of these boulders...they're expensive.
googme064	No.  I'm not wasting a boulder while the catapult's functioning properly.
googme065	I'd love to, but I can't.
googme066	My contract explicitly states that I'm not to leave Mêlée Island™ until this house has been demolished.
googme067	And risk incurring the wrath of the Mêlée Chamber of Commerce?  Not on your life.
googme068	Those guys are real leg-breakers.
googme069	It's this catapult!
googme070	I've never seen such a finicky piece of machinery.
googme071	Besides which, it throws like a girl!
googme072	Thanks.
googme073	19...
googme074	21...
googme075	45...
googme076	48...
googme077	0,0,0...
googme078	FI...
googme079	Hey, wait a minute.  That's right over us.
googme080	What are you trying to pull?
googme081	Why don't you go bother somebody else?
googme082	Huh?  What?
googme083	Don't do that!

googme099	Hey!  Get outta my way!
googme100	Yeah, yeah, I uh... Just a sec...
grgscu001	Buzz off, buzzard breath.
grgscu002	Listen, we're playing for the title of 'Grand Master Dart Champion of Mêlée Island™'
grgscu003	--Which you aren't--
grgscu004	No.
grgscu005	Those are.. uh.. from OTHER players.
grgscu006	No, really.  Pick a number; he'll hit it.
grgscu007	Actually, you WILL be able to join his crew, since I will be winning the Mêlée Island™ championship.
grgscu008	Knows me, cracker brain.
grgscu009	Nah.
grgscu010	The 'Official Tri-Island Dart Throwing Semi-Professional League Rulebook' clearly states:
grgscu011	'All dart competitions must be won by dart throwing skill...'
grgscu012	'...not by any other means such as bribery, insults, threats, or otherwise.'
grgscu013	Me.
grgscu014	Yeah, by one point.
grgscu015	I'm done.
guyall001	It's the official symbol of the governor's office.
guyall002	Nah.
guyall003	The header says: 'Mêlée Government Employment Contract -- Cushy Edition'
guyall004	Yoink!
guyall005	The header says: 'Mêlée Government Employment Contract'
guyall006	No one will care if I take this.
guyall007	Oh, this inner tube has no use here.
guyall008	Mmmm... kudu jerky pretzels...
guyall009	It's an empty pretzel bowl.
guyall010	(munch munch)
guyall011	<Sigh>  I wish I had some grog to wash that down with.
guyall012	There's nothing but crumbs left.
guyall013	If I go around offering these to everyone and everything I see, I won't have any for myself.
guyall014	It has all sorts of exciting tropical drink suggestions.
guyall015	I don't have a full bar.
guyall016	Hmmm let's see what it says...
guyall017	<Ahem>  My dearest Elaine,
guyall018	If you are reading this, then you are married, and I am dead.
guyall019	Now that you've finally settled down with a fearless pirate husband,
guyall020	it's time for you to claim the final pieces of your family's heritage.
guyall021	At the Lucre Island™ Municipal Bank, you'll find a safe deposit chest under my name.
guyall022	Among other things, the chest contains the deed to the Marley Mansion.
guyall023	Never lose sight of this deed.
guyall024	Furthermore, the chest also contains my wedding gifts to you.
guyall025	I'm sorry that I was unable to deliver them in person,
guyall026	But I go to my grave confident that you've chosen a man I would be proud to call 'grandson.'
guyall027	Lastly, and most importantly, the chest contains the keys to the most terrifying secret in the Caribbean;
guyall028	a secret ten times as terrifying as Big Whoop.  The Secret of...
guyall029	The ULTIMATE INSULT!
guyall030	Yipes!
guyall031	If the unholy power of the Ultimate Insult ever found its way into the wrong hands,
guyall032	there's no telling what sorts of heck-spawned mischief could be unleashed upon our fun-loving pirate citizens!
guyall033	Guard these secrets with your life, and know that, no matter where you are, your grandfather is watching over you.
guyall034	With all my love,
guyall035	Horatio Torquemeda Marley.
guyall036	How sweet.
guyall037	Uh, P.S. If your deadbeat parents come around looking for a handout, tell 'em to take a long walk off a short gangplank!
guyall038	Let's see...
guyall039	Blah blah blah Lucre Bank...
guyall040	...Yadda yadda safe deposit chest...
guyall041	...Deed to the Mansion: Good...
guyall042	...Wedding gifts: Good...
guyall043	...Ultimate Insult: Bad...
guyall044	Yours truly, H.T. Marley.
guyall045	It's a codpiece in like-new condition!
guyall046	Hey, there's a bottle of fine grog behind this codpiece.
guyall047	No, I don't think so.
guyall048	That doesn't need a codpiece.
guyall049	It's a cute little music box.
guyall050	Hey, there's a bottle of fine grog behind this music box.
guyall051	It's a broken sword
guyall052	It's an old, cracked sword.
guyall053	It's a whole heck of a lot of sponges.
guyall054	It's a bunch of sponges.
guyall055	It's a small handful of sponges.
guyall056	It's a bottle of the '67 Chateau de Spittle.  A fine vintage grog with an insouciant flavor and a saucy aftertaste.
guyall057	Hey, there's a little pile of sponges under this.
guyall058	No thanks, that thing reeks!
guyall059	It smells somewhat like hickory smoked fish.
guyall060	It smells sort of like flowers growing in a cesspool.
guyall061	It smells a little like fish snot.
guyall062	It smells a tiny bit like a corpse floating in a bog.
guyall063	Smells kinda like a lumberjack wiped his armpits with it.
guyall064	It has the faintest whiff of something nice, though.
guyall065	This hanky has 'P.P.' embroidered on it.
guyall066	I highly doubt that THIS belonged to Grandpa Marley.
guyall067	It's a little dead fish used for fishing bait.
guyall068	Ewww...
guyall069	It's sharp and hooky.
guyall070	Ow!  That's sharp!
guyall071	Nah, that doesn't need to get hooked.
guyall072	It's a wooden hand.
guyall073	It's a wooden hand infested with termites.
guyall074	It's a chewed up wooden hand.
guyall075	I'm using the hand.
guyall076	It looks pretty life-like, but it feels too stretchy to be real.
guyall077	No thanks.  My skin is perfectly fine the way it is.
guyall078	They're directions to Pegnose Pete's house.
guyall079	Weird.  Looks more like a train schedule to me.
guyall080	The name on it says...
guyall081	It has all sorts of useless information, such as: prosthetic prescriptions, address, phone number, allergies...
guyall082	This cane has an almost imperceptible crack in it.
guyall083	Hey!  I can hear the termites.  Must be dinner time.
guyall084	It's a pile of sawdust.
guyall085	If I had a hamster, I could use this stuff for bedding.
guyall086	There, that should make the concoction smell interesting.
guyall087	Nothing smells better than cedar cologne.
guyall088	It's a full bottle of perfume.
guyall089	It's called 'Eau de LeChuck.'
guyall090	'Now you can smell like the most infamous pirate the Caribbean has ever known.'
guyall091	'WARNING: The contents of this bottle should not be used on or near animals, anyone with a heart condition, or pregnant women.'
guyall092	Phew!
guyall093	This stuff smells bad, even for a pirate!
guyall094	That smells fine the way it is.
guyall095	It's a chess clock.
guyall096	It's just a clock with a timer.
guyall097	It's a little perfume spritzer filled with water.
guyall098	It's an empty perfume spritzer.
guyall099	It's a little perfume spritzer with a bunch of stuff in it.
guyall100	There's nothing in this bottle.
guyall101	The contents of this bottle are too dry to spritz.
guyall102	Hey!  This smells EXACTLY like that hanky, only stronger!
guyall103	It smells like water.
guyall104	This almost smells like that hanky...
guyall105	...except the hanky smells more like hamster bedding,
guyall106	...except the hanky smells more like hamster bedding.
guyall107	and more fishy.
guyall108	...except the hanky smells more fishy.
guyall109	more fishy,
guyall110	...except the hanky smells more fishy,
guyall111	and more pleasant.
guyall112	...except the hanky smells more pleasant.
guyall113	more pleasant,
guyall114	...except the hanky smells more pleasant,
guyall115	and more mucky.
guyall116	...except the hanky smells more mucky.
guyall117	What a distinct aroma!
guyall118	Nah, I'd prefer to keep this to myself and a select group of close friends.
guyall119	It's a pleasant smelling flower.
guyall120	This flower sure smells pleasant.
guyall121	Although that might look better with a flower, I think I'll hang on to it.
guyall122	There, that should make my concoction smell better.
guyall123	Nothing smells better than flowers.
guyall124	That's the second biggest duck I've ever had in my pants.
guyall125	Moo?!  What kinda weird duck are you?!
guyall126	Ew... greasy.
guyall127	I guess they use it on these iron maiden spikes to allow smooth impaling...
guyall128	No, I get enough grease eating fish and chips.
guyall129	That's greasy enough as it is.
guyall130	This pole seems to be missing something at the top.
guyall131	Hey, the hook snapped right in there.
guyall132	This pole has a hook jammed into the end of it.
guyall133	It's an empty ScupperWare container.
guyall134	It's filled with stinky bait.
guyall135	There's a little glowing fish sealed inside.
guyall136	Here fishy fishy fishy...
guyall137	Phew!  I better close this back up, before I attract sharks.
guyall138	No, my little fish might escape if I open it.
guyall139	Eh, I don't think the fishies are gonna just swim into an empty ScupperWare container without some incentive.
guyall140	There, now my bait will stay fresh.
guyall141	I can't fit any more bait in there.
guyall142	I better not open it, or my little fishy might escape.
guyall143	I already have something in there.
guyall144	Well, that doesn't need to be kept fresh.
guyall145	It's the stolen booty from the bank!
guyall146	Hey, what's this?
guyall147	A tiny screw.
guyall148	I'll bet it goes to Pegnose's prosthetic nose!
guyall149	Now I can clear the good name of Guybrush Threepwood!
guyall150	Hmm... I wonder what this little brass screw could be used for...
guyall151	I'm not sure what I am supposed to be screwing this into.
guyall152	It's a prosthetic nose!
guyall153	Booger free, too!
guyall154	No, my current nose works perfectly fine.
guyall155	'Grog Jr™.  All the Great Grog Taste With Only Two Percent of the Alcohol.'
guyall156	That is SO wrong.
guyall157	(slurp)
guyall158	Eeuugh!  Gross!
guyall159	'This coupon is redeemable at any Planet Threepwood diner and is good for one(1) Silver Monkey Mug Meal.'
guyall160	'Offer expires 12/25.  Void where prohibited.  Not valid in conjunction with any other offers, or to employees or slaves of the Planet Threepwood conglomerate.'
guyall161	This person doesn't work at Planet Threepwood.
guyall162	'Hyper Glue: Shakin's no use, cause it won't come loose!'
guyall163	Sounds like some pretty potent stuff.
guyall164	No, I think I already sniffed too much glue when I was five.
guyall165	Eh, I would rather not make that sticky.
guyall166	It's a reasonably good caricature of me with the Silver Monkey Mug
guyall167	If this picture was on an actual mug, it could actually pass as the real thing...
guyall168	If it was dark.  And the person looking was stupid.
guyall169	It doesn't seem to do anything by itself.
guyall170	Eh, I don't think that would accomplish much.
guyall171	Now I can stick this on something.
guyall172	It's an overpriced trendy mug with the StarBuccaneer's™ logo on it.
guyall173	There's nothing in it.
guyall174	Gee, this might actually pass as the real thing!
guyall175	The caricature won't stay on the mug by itself.
guyall176	That's a good idea, but I think it would be easier to put the glue on whatever I want to stick to it.
guyall177	Well look at that!  This may actually pass as the real thing.
guyall178	Perhaps I should keep this thing to myself until I need it.
guyall179	I only have this one thing.
guyall180	I better not do that here.
guyall181	I don't think it would be a good idea to take anything out right now.
guyall182	Nah, better not.
guyall183	I think I should keep it to myself for now.
guyall184	I don't have a thing to my name.
guyall185	Eh, I wonder what that is...
guyall186	I can't use this!
guyall187	Not picking that up.
guyall188	Nah.
guyall189	I don't think so.
guyall190	There's no way that's gonna fit in my pants.
guyall191	Mmmm.
guyall192	I can't reach it.
guyall193	It's empty.
guyall194	It's locked.
guyall195	(grunt)  It won't budge.
guyall196	With what?
guyall197	I don't think that would help anything
guyall198	Nobody there.
guyall199	Right.
guyall200	That's HUGE!
guyall201	Uh, no.
guyall202	That wouldn't be very nice.
guyall203	That would be against the pirate's code.
guyall204	I would, but it's full.
guyall205	Despite the great fun it would be, I'm not moving any furniture today.
guyall206	Not now.
guyall207	I'd rather not.
guyall208	That's not how you use one of those.
guyall209	Why would I want that?
guyall210	I already did that.
guyall211	I've already got some of that.
guyall212	I really don't need it.
guyall213	That's as far as it goes.
guyall214	It's nailed down.
guyall215	It's open.
guyall216	It's closed.
guyall217	It's a ladder.
guyall218	There's not enough room here for that.
guyall219	Not here!
guyall220	Eh, that's a good idea...Wish the designers had thought of it.
guyall221	Nah, too obvious.
guyall222	I can think of about a million uses for that object...too bad the designers don't want me to have it.
guyall223	Ah, the lovely Mrs. Threepwood.
guyall224	Nah, I think there was something in our marriage vows about that.
guyall225	I got the girl in the last game.
guyall226	It's a government paper of some sort.
guyall227	This inner tube looks as though it's been subjected to unspeakable stresses.
guyall228	Wow, these little sponges really expand!
guyall229	That might make it smell neat, but this bait is WAY too big to stuff in there.
guyall230	They're using it right now.
guyall231	Wow, this chest is filled with all kinds of valuable junk.
guyall232	I'm guessing that there's nothing of much value in here anymore.
guyall233	I'm afraid to rummage through this, lest I get my fingerprints all over everything.
guyall234	I have no idea what to do with this.  Maybe someone else does.
guyall235	There's nothing useful left in there.
guyall236	There's something scratched into the bottom of this.
guyall237	It says 'Mindy loves Fred.'
guyall238	It says 'Cindy loves Fred.'
guyall239	It says 'Wendy loves Fred.'
guyall240	It says 'Mindy loves Ned.'
guyall241	It says 'Cindy loves Ned.'
guyall242	It says 'Wendy loves Ned.'
guyall243	It says 'Mindy loves Jed.'
guyall244	It says 'Cindy loves Jed.'
guyall245	It says 'Wendy loves Jed.'
guyall246	...but scratched out right next to that it says 'Jerry loves Mindy.'
guyall247	...but scratched out right next to that it says 'Jerry loves Cindy.'
guyall248	...but scratched out right next to that it says 'Jerry loves Wendy.'
guyall249	...but scratched out right next to that it says 'Larry loves Mindy.'
guyall250	...but scratched out right next to that it says 'Larry loves Cindy.'
guyall251	...but scratched out right next to that it says 'Larry loves Wendy.'
guyall252	...but scratched out right next to that it says 'Harry loves Mindy.'
guyall253	...but scratched out right next to that it says 'Harry loves Cindy.'
guyall254	...but scratched out right next to that it says 'Harry loves Wendy.'
guyall255	What a weird place to profess your love for someone.
guyall256	I don't think she'd like that.
guyall257	I don't think he'd like that.
guyall258	This is the second largest duck I've ever held.
guyall259	And I ripped my face out of the picture first.
guyall260	With a sword...
guyall261	With a pistol...
guyall262	With a pile of treasure...
guyall263	...and a pegleg...
guyall264	...and an eye patch...
guyall265	...and a parrot on my shoulder...
guyall266	...reading a book down by the fire.
guyall267	...washing dishes with one hand, and mopping the floor with the other.
guyall268	...swinging a dead mouse around while entangled in a fishing net.
guyall269	He made me look all goofy and cartoony...
guyall270	Guess it fooled them.  They still think this is the real Monkey Mug.
guyall271	(schlurp)!
guyall272	I don't want a cheap imitation.
guyall273	It's one of the many proud monkeys of Monkey Island™.
guyall274	Here, have a banana...
guyall275	Here, monkey monkey monkey...
guyall276	Hey, monkey, look what I've got...
guyall277	I don't want to get monkey cooties all over that.
guyall278	So.  I see you are trained in the arts of Monkey Kombat.
guyall279	I have no idea what he just said, but somehow I feel mildly insulted.
guyall280	It's Elaine's pet monkey, Timmy.
guyall281	Here, have a banana...
guyall282	He's already following me.
guyall283	I don't want to make him sick.
guyall284	I don't think Timmy would like that.
guyall285	It seems to have fallen into the machinery.
guyall286	It's a StanCo brand weed whipper.
guyall287	'It slices and dices your strongest weeds into table salad.'
guyall288	Got it!
guyall289	I need to use this ON something.
guyall290	That's not a weed, and it doesn't need to be whipped.
guyall291	It's an ordinary banana.
guyall292	It's two ordinary bananas.
guyall293	It's a whole bunch of ordinary bananas.
guyall294	I don't want any more bananas.
guyall295	<chomp>
guyall296	That wouldn't go well with bananas.
guyall297	It's a gold-plated banana picker with a man-shaped handle.
guyall298	It's a gold-plated banana picker.
guyall299	Hey, the handle of this is shaped like a little man.
guyall300	Funny that I didn't notice that last time I had this thing.
guyall301	It's not so useful without a banana to pick.
guyall302	It's not so useful without a hard to reach object to pick up.
guyall303	It's a little, metal milk bottle.
guyall304	It's useless.
guyall305	Is it just me, or do these things look like they'd make good bowling balls?
guyall306	What fun is it to juggle just one thing?
guyall307	It says 'H.T.' on it.
guyall308	I don't play the accordion.
guyall309	What tiny shields.  They must've been used in really tiny battles.
guyall310	Hmmmm.
guyall311	My makeshift cymbals.
guyall312	What a pretty, bronze hat.
guyall313	Too much monkey hair in there for me.
guyall314	Wow, I actually get to use this banana picker more than once!
guyall315	This banana picker is really starting to come in handy.
guyall316	I sure am glad I've got this banana picker.
guyall317	Gee, I don't know what I'd do without this banana picker.
guyall318	This banana picker sure makes solving puzzles easy.
guyall319	I wonder how I ever got along before I had this banana picker.
guyall320	It's a small packing sponge.
guyall321	It's a packing sponge.
guyall322	It's a large packing sponge.
guyall323	No thanks.  A grog this old could probably eat through most of my internal organs.
guyall324	Ew.
guyall325	My current liver is functioning just fine.
guyall326	These feet are HUGE!
guyall327	Maybe later.
guyall328	This thing is rusty!
guyall329	Only cows need two stomachs.
guyall330	Now I've got the guts to do anything!
guyall331	I don't have the nerve to use these guts.
guyall332	This thing looks more like a bilge pump than a heart.
guyall333	I like my current heart just fine.
guyall334	My heart belongs to Elaine, I can't give it away.
guyall335	This invention is really ahead of its time.
guyall336	The day I need a prosthetic head is the day I need a new, um...what's the word...oh yeah, brain.
guyall337	Behind every great pirate, there's a great butt.
guyall338	No thanks.  If worse comes to worst, I'll use my own.
guyall339	That's curious...it doesn't seem to be moving.
guyall340	It's a rather unspectacular duck.
guyall341	I'm sure this is useful...but how?
guyall342	Yowch!  That sure is hot!!
guyall343	I better do something with it soon.  I can't hang onto it much longer!
guyall344	I don't think this coal will be of any use by itself...
guyall345	They're a pair of old, wooden earrings.
guyall346	And they're pink.
guyall347	Nah, I don't think they'd go with my outfit.
guyall348	This new pen-necklace invention of mine will make me millions!
guyall349	People will be able to write at any time, whether they want to or not!
guyall350	This necklace looks new.. I wonder how it got in with the rest of these old heirlooms.
guyall351	I've had enough constricting jewelry for one adventure.
guyall352	Now the wearer of this necklace will always be able to find a pen.
guyall353	This pen says 'Second Bank of Lucre' on it.
guyall354	It must have fallen in the chest during the robbery...I'd hate to think that Grandpa Marley stole it.
guyall355	I need something to write on.
guyall356	I'm not very talented when it comes to drawing.
guyall357	It's got a map on one side, and a picture of the ultimate insult on the other.
guyall358	It's Meathook's painting, modified to show the route to Jambalaya Island™.
guyall359	It's a painting from Meathook's 'blue period', depicting what appears to be the entire Tri-Island Area.
guyall360	Hmmm....
guyall361	No comment.
guyall362	This paintbrush seems pretty solid.
guyall363	I've got nothing to paint on.
guyall364	I don't have any paint.
guyall365	Not to mention any artistic ability.
guyall366	Ahhh.. ice cold, refreshing grog.
guyall367	Uhh...
guyall368	No grog until my errands are finished.
guyall369	They're cheap, crummy, mass-produced, wooden chopsticks.
guyall370	I don't think so... every time Elaine tries to teach me how to use these things, I end up with a bowl of hot saki in my lap.
guyall371	It's a coin.
guyall372	I'm rich!
guyall373	I can't use it while it's sitting there.
guyall374	That doesn't need any money.
guyall375	It's a silver mug that looks a LOT like a monkey head.  Spooky.
guyall376	This thing is scary looking.
guyall377	After all the work I went through to get this thing, there's no way I'm just gonna drink from it.
guyall378	I think they would notice if I just snatched their beloved Monkey Mug and ran off with it.
guyall379	There must be some way to grab it, but make them think it's still here...
guyall380	There, I'm two-thirds of the way to having my own personal Ultimate Insult.
guyall381	It's an empty StarBuccaneer's™ groggoccino cup.
guyall382	It's a frosty cup of StarBuccaneer's™ groggoccino.
guyall383	Woooohooo!
guyall384	Talk about your eye-openers!  I feel like I just drank an entire coffee plantation, donkeys and all!
guyall385	Ohhh.  I think the groggoccino is wearing off.
guyall386	Yuck.  This thing looks almost as bad as it tasted.
guyall387	It's a mini-bagel with some artificial lox and cream cheese spread on it.
guyall388	There's no way I'm putting that back in my mouth.
guyall389	Welp, here goes nothing...
guyall390	<Gulp>  Oh.  <Chomp>  PLLLPHHHTT!!  PTUI!
guyall391	GOOD GRAVY!  That tastes HORRIBLE!
guyall392	EUUGGUhhHH!
guyall393	It says I'm globally certified and physically fit to compete in any Tri-Island Area world diving competitions.
guyall394	It just doesn't match my shoes.
guyall395	I feel like a dork wearing this here.
guyall396	Pointy.
guyall397	It's a golden trophy of a man in a classic 'arms-over-head' diving pose.
guyall398	Hey, there's a picture of Edd the diving judge in here.
guyall399	...but that blonde he's with is definitely NOT his lovely red-headed wife.
guyall400	...and that must be his beautiful blonde wife that he's with.
guyall401	It's a brochure for Stan's timeshare.
guyall402	It's a parrot whistle.
guyall403	It's a cute little whistle.  I can't imagine what so piratey about it.
guyall404	Hmm.. it kinda sounds like a parrot.
guyall405	I guess there aren't any parrots within range.
guyall406	'The Lighter Side of Walking the Plank.'
guyall407	'Snappy Answers to Stupid Insults.'
guyall408	'The Hearse of Monkey Aye-yai-yai-land, A SCABB Magazine Parody.'
guyall409	'Captain Sergio's Marginally Funny Etchings.'
guyall410	'You Know You're a Cabin Boy When...'
guyall411	Wow, potzrebie bounces.  Who knew?
guyall412	'What, Me Scurvy?'
guyall413	'More Junk from the Usual Gang of Idiot Pirates.'
guyall414	It's a classic 1582 Mercedes Bends racing schooner.
guyall415	I outgrew toys like this WEEKS ago.
guyall416	It's a rare LeChuckichu Pirate-man gaming card.
guyall417	I won't risk putting this card into play unless it's absolutely necessary.
guyall418	I haven't been this proud of an accomplishment since...
guyall419	...wait a minute!  I'm not proud of this!
guyall420	As a matter of fact, I should burn this before anyone catches me with it.
guyall421	No way!  I'm not showing this to anyONE or anyTHING!
guyall422	This little Guybrush puppet sure is cute.
guyall423	On the other hand (literally), this LeChuck puppet is downright creepy.
guyall424	I better put these away before Casaba flings a cannonball at me.
guyall425	Hello there little Guybrush.
guyall426	Arrr!!  Talk to me!
guyall427	No!  Talk to me!
guyall428	That's it.. I'm not talking to either of you!
guyall429	It's the tiny, bronzed pirate hat of a tiny, bronzed pirate.
guyall430	Shiny.
guyall431	It's too heavy to use as a hat.  It's made of bronze.
guyall432	Hmmm. These things seem to WANT to be together.
guyall433	But I think there's something missing.
guyall434	All I need now is the part that looks like a golden man.
guyall435	All I need now is the hat.
guyall436	That looks just like the picture of the Ultimate Insult!
guyall437	I don't think it'll work until it's complete.
guyall438	I'm not exactly sure HOW to use it.
guyall439	The Ultimate Insult is now complete!
guyall440	Soon I will be the most powerful pirate in the Caribbean!
guyall441	Muahahahahahahha!
guyall442	If only I knew how to use this thing.
guyall443	It's a cedar-smelling pile of wood shavings.
guyall444	'Promotion subject to change.  So don't bug us if it does.'
guyall445	I better put these away before Miss Rivers confiscates them.
guyall446	Arrrr! I don't want to talk to that!
guyall447	I don't feel like talking right now.
guyall448	Arr! Ye sissy!
guyall449	No, I'd feel too goofy.
guyall450	ARRRRRR!
guyall451	Oh, shut up.
guyall452	I'm Guybrush Threepwood mighty pi....
guyall453	No you're not!  I'm Guybrush Threepwood!
guyall454	You're both wrong!  I'M Guybrush Threepwood!
guyall455	Give up LeChuck!  You'll never defeat me!
guyall456	Please don't hurt me Guybrush!
guyall457	I better put these away before Casaba thinks we're conspiring against him and shoots his cannon at me.
guyall458	Elaine would probably kill me if I went around misusing this.
guyall459	I'm already a government employee... I think.
guyall460	I already have the cushiest job on the island.
guyall461	I'm not sure if Elaine would approve of that.
guyall462	That won't help anything.
guyall463	No, this is a very personal letter... for Elaine.. and me.
guyall464	A broken sword wouldn't help.
guyall465	That doesn't need to be sliced up.
guyall466	That doesn't need a sponge.
guyall467	That would be a waste.
guyall468	I don't really need to wipe that.
guyall469	This broken, rusty old sword wouldn't cut butter, let alone bait.
guyall470	I guess this isn't the right kind of bait for that.
guyall471	I don't think that needs a fake arm.
guyall472	That doesn't need a fake skin.
guyall473	I've created a monster!
guyall474	Oooh, that's not a pretty sight.
guyall475	It's aliiiiiiive!
guyall476	I think I've got a bit more fine tuning before I can take this... thing... out for a test run.
guyall477	Now my creation is complete!
guyall478	A fake liver won't help that.
guyall479	I prefer to keep my feet to myself.
guyall480	Only cows need more than one stomach.
guyall481	That doesn't need a prosthetic stomach.
guyall482	I don't think guts would work with that.
guyall483	I'll keep it for now, because two heads are better than one.
guyall484	That's just plain sick.
guyall485	After all I've done to get this, I think I'll hang on to it.
guyall486	I better hang onto this in case I need to give it back.
guyall487	That doesn't need wood shavings.
guyall488	These heirlooms are too valuable to waste on that.
guyall489	Those things really don't go together.
guyall490	The Ultimate Insult looks like it's comprised of three parts:
guyall491	A silver monkey head, a bronze hat and a golden man.
guyall492	I wonder how it works.
guyall493	If I go around showing off the plans to the Ultimate Insult, then someone might gather and assemble it before me.
guyall494	That won't appreciate the painting like I do.
guyall495	That doesn't need a painting with a map to Jambalaya Island™ on it.
guyall496	That doesn't need painting.
guyall497	As much as I'd like to, the Harbor Mistress wouldn't like it, and she scares me.
guyall498	No!  My grog!
guyall499	It says it can only be redeemed by staff of Planet Threepwood.
guyall500	I don't really want to show this off.
guyall501	I don't think I should be flashing this thing around in here.
guyall502	They look similar, but I don't think they're quite that dumb here.
guyall503	That doesn't need a caffeine buzz.
guyall504	I think I'd like to try it myself, first.
guyall505	I'm keeping this.
guyall506	Hey, there's a picture of that grouchy diving judge in here.
guyall507	There's a big picture of some couple in here that I don't recognize.
guyall508	I'm not trading this to anyone.
guyall509	No, I need to use it in my Ultimate Insult.
guyall510	That doesn't seem like a good use for this.
guyall511	Although driving Pegnose out of his house with cheesy music seems like a good idea, I think I'll have to try something harsher.
guyall512	Whew, this thing reeks.
guyall513	Nothing like the smell of rotting bait to woo the ladies.
guyall514	No, this is a collection of EXPERIMENTAL prosthetic devices.
guyall515	That's probably not a good idea.
guyall516	I'd better not... grog is super bad for the liver.
guyall517	I think this smells bad enough the way it is.
guyall518	I'd better not.  Over the years I've learned the hard way that it's unwise to bait a duck.
guyall519	Looks like high quality wood, though.
guyall520	I'm surprised termites haven't infested it.
guyall521	That doesn't look like it needs picking.
guyall522	I can't quite reach it with my hands.
guyall523	That needs a coconut like it needs a big, frilly hat.
guyall524	This hat really doesn't GO with that.
guyall525	I'm not giving that back.
guyall526	I'm not giving that back... I worked too hard for it.
guyall527	It's a painting...curious, it seems to be made of wax.
guyall528	It's just the usual skullduggery.
guyall529	I'm not picking that up.
guyall530	I think that I've blown up enough boulders for the day.
guyall531	I don't think they'd like that.
guyban001	Hey!  A prosthetic nose!
guyban002	Ugh... Gross.
guyban003	I'll bet this belongs to that smelly pirate guy.  The one with no nose.
guyban004	Ack!
guyban005	What are you doing in here?
guyban006	Let's go try it on Pegnose!
guyban007	You still think I did it, don't you?
guyban008	He should switch to decaf.
guyban009	Hey, what's all the commotion?
guyban010	Aaaaaaaaagh!!
guyban011	It wasn't me!  It was the no-nosed bandit!
guyban012	You'll find it with the real robber!
guyban013	So let me go, and get cracking!
guyban014	Okay, what?
guyban015	You know, it would be a lot easier if I could just bribe you.
guyban016	I get to go back to the mansion and play with Timmy?
guyban017	I was wondering about that.
guyban018	It's rather uncomfortable, can you loosen it?
guyban019	<Sigh>  At least I'm not in jail.
guyban020	WHOOOOAAA!
guyban021	Oof!
guyban022	That pudgy guy must be the bank manager.
guyban023	Um... excuse me...
guyban024	But I just have a quick...
guyban025	Hi.  I'm here to pick up the Marley family heirlooms.
guyban026	Um.  Threepwood.
guyban027	She looks a little, uh, lightheaded.
guyban028	I'm married.
guyban029	That leads upstairs.
guyban030	Why do people keep trying to put ladders in my pants?
guyban031	That leads back down to the bank area.
guyban032	Strangely, the idea of carrying a ladder around does not excite me.
guyban033	That turns on the lights around the bank.
guyban034	I wonder what would happen if I pull it?
guyban035	It controls that light!  Technology marches forward!
guyban036	I can probably reach it better from up there.
guyban037	Ow!  That's HOT!
guyban038	It looks pretty well attached to the wall.
guyban039	I can probably get a better peek at it from up there.
guyban040	What's that shadow?
guyban041	It looks like... a nose?!
guyban042	It's a light fixture.
guyban043	I don't think you can turn it on and off from here.
guyban044	It's controlled by a switch somewhere.
guyban045	I suppose this is the only way in or out of this place for now.
guyban046	It's already open.
guyban047	Free Scupperware promotion today!
guyban048	Just open an account with 10,000 pieces of eight or more.
guyban049	I really don't need that calendar.
guyban050	'April 1 - Tell everybody their money is gone.'
guyban051	'June 6 - Break J. Flabby's legs if he hasn't repaid loan.'
guyban052	'January 1 - Y1.6K: Make sure abacus still works.'
guyban053	'February 14 - Give away free Valentine's day steaks.'
guyban054	'October 31 - Everybody put on suits and act like gentlemen.'
guyban055	Wow.  That's just MEAN.
guyban056	Eeeegh, note to self: do not default on any bank loans from here.
guyban057	Phht.  Like anything is gonna happen.
guyban058	Whoa!  I gotta remember to come here THAT day!
guyban059	Scary...
guyban060	It's full of reminders...
guyban061	They're already giving away free Scupperware.  There's no reason to take their calendar as well.
guyban062	Nobody can do mental math anymore...
guyban063	Huh!  What do you know!  One plus one really does equal two!
guyban064	No way!  REAL pirates don't need to add!
guyban065	Instead, we hire our pirate brethren, the accountants, to add and keep track of our treasure for us.
guyban066	Ugh.  It's full of names, and numbers, and lots and lots of MATH.
guyban067	Plundering helpless and unwitting natives of exotic islands is one thing...
guyban068	But stealing money from a bank by forging ledger entries... that's just so boring.
guyban069	No way, I'm trying to CLEAR my name of a robbery, not commit ANOTHER one!
guyban070	What would I want with a ledger?
guyban071	'Pyrate!' magazine.  Popular news of the Caribbean's most scandalous and nefarious pirates.
guyban072	And in this month's issue, how to loot and pillage and still be there for the kids!
guyban073	I don't have time to read.
guyban074	'Thinking about that new ship?'
guyban075	'Low 4.0% APR.'
guyban076	(Subject to approval, other fees may apply.  We do not extend credit to pirates.)  Figures.
guyban077	I don't need a loan advertisement.
guyban078	This must be the new thing in low maintenance decorating.
guyban079	You don't even have to water it.
guyban080	No.  I'd be too ashamed to hang it up.
guyban081	I've always wondered how they get the ship in there.
guyban082	That's the second most useless trinket I've ever seen.
guyban083	I believe this would qualify as a 'luscious' fern.
guyban084	I'm SURE if I really needed to use the bathroom, the bank manager would let me.
guyban085	Nah, I leave the home decorating to Elaine.
guyban086	I guess some deadbeat couldn't pay back his loan.
guyban087	I've got no use for used barrels.
guyban088	I sure hope the previous owner got a chance to empty their underwear drawer.
guyban089	I've got no use for a used dresser.
guyban090	Aww, how cuuute!  Little tiny treasure chests that you can't actually fit anything into.
guyban091	I can't actually fit anything useful into those.
guyban092	Nah, I prefer treasure chests of the larger variety.
guyban093	That goes back outside to town.
guyban094	I can't go out that way... Inspector Canard is watching the entrance.
guyban095	It's outta commission.
guyban096	That's the door to the bank vault.
guyban097	It's a little too heavy for me.
guyban098	Oh no.  I'm not going in there again.
guyban099	I should talk to the teller first.
guyban100	Hi there.
guyban101	What happened to the First Bank of Lucre?
guyban102	I'd like to make a deposit.
guyban103	No.
guyban104	I need to make a withdrawal.
guyban105	I'd like a loan, please.
guyban106	I'd like to retrieve some items from my safe deposit box.
guyban107	Marley.  H. T. Marley.
guyban108	Here's a letter that might help.
guyban109	I'm her dashing husband!
guyban110	Oh, well, there is this...
guyban111	No free toasters!?!?  I'm leaving.
guyban112	I'm going to repaint my ship.
guyban113	It's pink.
guyban114	I'm going to hire a new crew.
guyban115	Uhhh, that's okay.  Never mind.
guyban116	I've always wanted jewel-encrusted bunny slippers.
guyban117	Really?  I mean, yes, of course.
guyban118	I want a life-size chocolate pirate ship.
guyban119	And not the hollow kind.
guyban120	Makes sense to me.  When can I have the money?  I'm getting kind of hungry.
guyban121	Just kidding.  I don't want your money.
guyban122	I'm a mighty pirate.
guyban123	I'm married to the Governor.
guyban124	I'm a game designer.
guyban125	Nothing, but I sure spend a lot.
guyban126	Umm, nothing.
guyban127	I make quite the pretty penny.
guyban128	I can afford to buy this whole island!
guyban129	I'll come back when I make some money.
guyban130	Why hello there, Brittany.
guyban131	Oh, heh, ah, sorry.
guyban132	Sorry you lost your job.
guyban133	What are you gonna do now?
guyban134	Is it too late to open an account?
guyban135	I know someone who has a crush on you.
guyban136	Well, I have manly things to do in a sensitive way.  Bye.
guyban137	What kind of show business?
guyban138	Me too.  Maybe we could start an act together.
guyban139	Piratey?
guyban140	Then why were you wasting away at the bank?
guyban141	Hope that works out for you.
guyban142	That Castaneda fellow.
guyban143	You know, the chess player.
guyban144	The bank manager.
guyban145	I do.
guyban146	Well, uh...
guyban147	Never mind, it's not important.
guyban148	My pleasure, Inspector.  Be sure to tell Pegnose that I'll be by in a few minutes to PROVE his guilt!
guyban149	I'd better not... I'd hate for him to think I stole something from the bank.
guyban150	I'd better not... I'd hate for her to think I stole something from the bank.
guybas001	Phew!
guybas002	It smells like dead fish in here!
guybas003	Perhaps they ran off to join another circus?
guybas004	If that's fresh, I don't wanna know what old bait smells like.
guybas005	Gentle player.  At this point, you should be thankful that your computer does not have odor emulation capability.
guybas006	This place smells horrible.  I mean, really bad.  So bad, in fact that...
guybas007	Oh, it'll only take a minute.
guybas008	He smells like he runs this place.
guybas009	Uh... Just looking at him makes my eyes burn.
guybas010	It's a large, stinky vat of free bait, marinating in bait juice.
guybas011	Hmmmmmm...
guybas012	It's just not as much fun without the termites.
guybas013	Whee!  Look at the cute little termite circus!
guybas014	It's just like a flea circus, but with termites!
guybas015	That was exciting.
guybas016	Oh, sorry.
guybas017	Hmm.  This requires stealth.
guybas018	Come and get it, boys!
guybas019	Ha!  Look at those little buggers go.  They must be real hungry for the taste of redwood.
guybas020	I've already taken all the termites.
guybas021	This must be where the magic happens.
guybas022	This bait has already been fully prepped.
guybas023	I only see five kinds of dead fish here!
guybas024	Caviar?  In a bait shop?
guybas025	Hmmm... the fine print says. 'May not be fit for human or animal consumption.'
guybas026	Even if I LIKED caviar, I wouldn't take that stuff!
guybas027	The concept of bait shop caviar scares me.
guybas028	Hmmm... let's see...
guybas029	'One Armed Sam's Shark Repellent'...
guybas030	'Chub Rub Bait Scent'...
guybas031	'Groggy Sailor Smelling Salts'...
guybas032	I wonder what 'Mackerel Smacker' is...
guybas033	'Grandma Pete's Dolphin Safe Tuna Net'...
guybas034	There's quite a selection here.
guybas035	Nothing up there looks very appealing.
guybas036	I wonder what kind of bait was used to catch this guy.
guybas037	I'm not really in need of shark jaws at the moment.
guybas038	Oooh, it's the 'Grouper Master 3000' series with 'bamboo composite core'.
guybas039	Nah, I'd have no use for it.
guybas040	I can never seem to bring myself around to stabbing poor, defenseless little worms with hooks.
guybas041	Sharp.
guybas042	No thanks...I try to keep the number of large pointy things in my pants to an absolute minimum.
guybas043	I haven't seen so many glassy, lifeless stares since my wedding reception.
guybas044	Contrary to popular legends, fish heads are neither roley nor poley.
guybas045	I doubt that I'll be needing a fish head.  And even if I do, I'm not picking one up.
guybas046	Oh humble egress, where wilt thou lead me?
guybas047	Excuse me.
guybas048	Do you have any bait that could catch a cold?
guybas049	Do you have any bait that could catch a tiger by the tail?
guybas050	Do you have any bait that could catch a thief?
guybas051	Do you have any bait that could catch a sneaky Australian?
guybas052	Do you have any bait that could catch a Red Grouper?
guybas053	Gotcha.
guybas054	How's the bait business?
guybas055	Heh, you're telling me.  P-U!
guybas056	Is the bait business getting any better?
guybas057	Do you know anything about a no-nosed pirate thief?
guybas058	You know him?
guybas059	I'd like to hear some more about Pegnose Pete.
guybas060	I'm almost afraid to ask...but why are you running a termite circus?
guybas061	Stench?
guybas062	Well, is it working?
guybas063	It sure stinks in here!
guybas064	How touching... not to mention revolting.
guybas065	Why is that bait over there free?
guybas066	How does bait go bad?
guybas067	I think I'll just look around for a while.
guybas068	Really?  How?
guybas069	By hostile invaders?
guybas070	Yipes!
guybas071	Go figure.
guybas072	I bet business would pick up if you'd crack open a window every now and then.
guybas073	Did it help?
guybas074	Strange?  How so?
guybas075	Hmmm... that's odd...
guybas076	I would've thought that a shop full of worms, fish entrails, and maggots would be a 'can't miss' venture in this swashbuckling environment.
guybas077	So, what's changed?
guybas078	Why?
guybas079	Who is he?
guybas080	I've seen his true face.  It's not pretty.
guybas081	Where can I find him?
guybas082	Great!  I'm off to the Marshe!
guybas083	Darn.  Another curse.
guybas084	Where did you say I can find him?
guybas085	Ohhh yeah... I forgot that part.
guybas086	How did he lose his nose?
guybas087	THAT'S one of the 'darkest mysteries' of Lucre Island™?
guybas088	How does he smell without a nose, anyway?
guybas089	I guess I should've seen that one coming.
guybas090	Let's talk about something else.
guybas091	It'd probably be a bad idea to wave his stolen stars in front of his face.
guybas092	I can scoop up a whole bunch of bait with this!
guycan001	I wonder how these rocks managed to get stacked this way?
guycan002	Looks like the result of an exciting ride.
guycan003	It's WAY too heavy.
guycan004	These appear to be sedimentary rocks that were once submerged under water in this canyon that clearly was previously a riverbed in prehistoric Monkey Island™.
guycan005	I'm not interested in an archaeological dig.
guycan006	Boy, that thing sure flew far.
guycan007	There's an entrance into a mine shaft here.
guycan008	There's an awful lot of heat emanating from the mine now.
guycan009	I'm not going into any cave that is hot and smells like burning rotten eggs.
guycan010	This path leads back to Monkey Island™.
guycan011	There's just a big empty flat area over there.
guycan012	It's just a box canyon, so it'd be a waste of time to explore further.
guycgs001	Are you crazy?  You could've killed me!
guycgs002	Huh?
guycgs003	Uh, excuse me, sir?
guycgs004	Uhhh, yeah.  Anyway...
guycgs005	That's none of your business.
guycgs006	Uh, Guybrush Threepwood, sir.
guycgs007	Ivanna Tinkle.
guycgs008	Who wants to know?
guycgs009	Guybrush Threepwood.  Who the heck are you?
guycgs010	None of your darn business, Mister Prissypants!
guycgs011	I'm just looking around, sir.
guycgs012	That's for me to know, and for you to find out.
guycgs013	I'm here to cause trouble.  Lots of it.
guycgs014	I'm on a quest to find the Ultimate Insult, and I'll eviscerate anyone who gets in my way!
guycgs015	Who the heck ARE you?
guycgs016	How'd you get a name like 'Ricardo Luigi Pierre M'Benga Chang Nehru O'Hara Casaba the Third'?
guycgs017	What are you doing here?
guycgs018	Well, how many of Knuttin's pirates have been allowed to return to Jambalaya?
guycgs019	Why are you firing cannonballs at innocent pirates?
guycgs020	What was that middle part again?
guycgs021	Do you really fling cannonballs at any group of pirates you happen to spot?
guycgs022	Really?  All I can hear are some seagulls.
guycgs023	I think I'll just be on my merry way.
guycgs024	That guy seems pretty grumpy.
guycgs025	They're aimed at that beach.
guycgs026	I seem to be on the unpleasant end of the cannon, and using it would probably not be a health-conscious thing to do.
guycgs027	There's a picture of a koala bear.  Obviously the work of a certain awful Australian.
guycgs028	It's a ship o' the line.
guycgs029	I have my own ship.  And besides, I refuse to sail a ship with a koala bear on the sail!
guycgs030	Then again... my ship IS pink.
guycgs031	The last haven for pirates.
guycgs032	It's frightening even from here.
guycol001	It's times like this that I wish I'd become a Mighty Chartered Accountant...
guycol002	I don't think Elaine and I will be renewing our vows this way...
guycol003	What kind of word is 'flume,' anyway? Flume, flume, flume, flume...
guycol004	Oh, the lava is hotter than a flame-broiled otter, and my shoes are slowly melting to the fiberglass floor
guycol005	Oh, my sweat's vaporizing as the temperature's rising, and I cannot feel my legs below my knees anymore.
guycol006	You know, it's little things like this that keep start-up religions from getting the respect they deserve...
guycol007	If this is what they do for weddings, I'd hate to see what their confessions are like...
guycol008	I have a very bad feeling about this...
guycol009	Really hot in some places, kind of bumpy in others, and impossible to control.
guycol010	Yeah.
guycol011	Yikes!
guycol012	'The First Church of LeChuck?'
guycol013	You're kidding, right?
guycol014	How could you build a religion around LeChuck?  He's an unholy demon pirate from Heck!
guycol015	Well how does the Church of LeChuck compare to other major religions?
guycol016	Eh, that's kinda what I imagined.
guycol017	Don't look now, but there's a river of lava flowing through the middle of your church.
guycol018	How does this stream of lava fit into the church's wedding ceremonies?
guycol019	Doesn't that kill them?
guycol020	I'd like to try your lava plunge.
guycol021	Um, I'm already married.  And my wife is several islands away being harassed by bad guys.
guycol022	Aw, c'mon, let me ride a boat down a river of molten lava.
guycol023	(What am I saying?)
guycol024	What?
guycol025	I'd like to take another test ride on your matrimonial lava plunge.
guycol026	That's the spirit!
guycol027	Eh, what was that you said about LeChuck and Elaine getting married?
guycol028	'Chaste?'
guycol029	Elaine can't marry LeChuck; she's already married!
guycol030	Who?
guycol031	Guybrush Threepwood?
guycol032	I'M the Anti-LeChuck?
guycol033	But his name IS 'Guybrush Threepwood,' right?
guycol034	Are you some sort of hologram or something?
guycol035	And you're a priest.
guycol036	So, you're sort of a holy ghost, then?
guycol037	How'd a ghost like you end up running the First Church of LeChuck?
guycol038	Why do I keep asking people their life stories?
guycol039	And then you met LeChuck?
guycol040	Uh... I hate when that happens.
guycol041	Eww.  Icky.
guycol042	Well, how'd you go from being a ghost pirate to a ghost PRIEST?
guycol043	Well, how do you like being a ghost priest?
guycol044	I could use some advice, padre.
guycol045	This is too creepy for words.  I'm outta here.
guycol046	I need to find a way to get off this fershlugginer island.
guycol047	That's not true.  I've escaped it on at least two occasions.
guycol048	I, um, can't.
guycol049	I'd still like to Escape from Monkey Island™.
guycol050	Jeez, that's discouraging.
guycol051	I'm looking for an antidote to the Ultimate Insult.
guycol052	It's a voodoo talisman that shatters the souls of pirates.
guycol053	Well that's okay, my plight could use some simplifying.
guycol054	I'm still looking for an antidote to the Ultimate Insult.
guycol055	I've got a couple of evil shnooks on my back.
guycol056	Run like a cowardly dog?
guycol057	How?
guycol058	Eh, on second thought, getting advice from an obsessed ghost priest seems like a bad idea.
guycol059	Baptisms?
guycol060	Well, I guess that's one way to cure cold feet.
guycol061	Funerals?
guycol062	Bar Mitzvahs?
guycol063	Um, your Holiness?
guycol064	Those look pretty uncomfortable.
guycol065	I think I'd have to use my plush prosthetic butt if I had to sit on one of these pews for a Sunday morning sermon of evil.
guycol066	I don't think I want to hear his sermon on LeChuck, Fire, Brimstone, and why He deserves Elaine.
guycol067	I don't even know what I would be worshipping if I sat here.
guycol068	That's where the priest usually stands.
guycol069	I don't think I'm qualified to give a sermon of any kind.
guycol070	It looks fun, but in a scary kind of way.
guycol071	Oh no.  A ghost.  Even worse, it looks like a ghost PRIEST.
guycol072	No way.  I'd probably turn into a crazed undead zombie pirate even if I just looked at the pictures.
guycol073	This place must fuel LeChuck's ego like gas on a fire.
guycol074	It's a stained glass window with a picture of LeChuck in his zombie pirate form.
guycol075	It's a stained glass window with a picture of LeChuck in his most frightening form -- Charles L. Charles.
guycol076	It's a stained glass window with a picture of LeChuck in his flaming demon ghost form.
guycol077	'You must be this tall to ride this ride.'
guycol078	Well, at least their heating bill must be pretty low.
guycol079	Um, no, I'm not quite frustrated enough to jump into a stream of molten lava just yet.
guycol080	He's a ghost.  He doesn't need to eat.
guycol081	That must be the most unholiest of bibles.
guycpt001	Who are you?
guycpt002	Hellbeard?  I think I've heard of you...
guycpt003	If you're Hellbeard, where have you been for the past 80 years...
guycpt004	Can I talk to the other puppet?
guycpt005	Heh.  Seriously, where's the other puppet?
guycpt006	Can I talk to your puppeteer?
guycpt007	C'mon, let me talk to the puppeteer.
guycpt008	Do you know anything about the Ultimate Insult?
guycpt009	But--
guycpt010	You've got a lot of attitude for a sock.
guycpt011	See ya, 'Hellbeard.'
guycpt012	Waitaminute...Hellbeard the Unrepentant died over 80 years ago!
guycpt013	No, you LOOK like a sock.
guycpt014	I read about you in school.  You cut off the heads of seventy men with a sharpened spoon.
guycpt015	My dad used to tell me stories about you.  Did you really sink five ships with your steely gaze?
guycpt016	I heard that you once outdueled the Devil for a pack of gum.
guycpt017	I thought the other puppet was Hellbeard.
guycpt018	I'll be as gentle as a baby dolphin.
guycpt019	Can I talk to the puppeteer again?
guycpt020	I'd have to be some sort of sadist to do that.
guycpt021	Do you know anything else about the Ultimate Insult?
guycpt022	I guess you're right.
guycpt023	Why can I only talk to one of you at a time?
guycpt024	Can't he tell the difference between pirates and puppets?
guycpt025	You're remarkably level-headed for a guy named Hellbeard.
guycpt026	I'll be back.
guycpt027	Hellbeard...
guycpt028	You must be Hellbeard.
guycpt029	You don't look like a fearsome pirate to me.
guycpt030	Eh, but you're Hellbeard the Unrepentant!  You sacked an entire archipelago with a row boat and the jawbone of a bilge rat named 'Stinky.'
guycpt031	Why do your puppets look like me and LeChuck?
guycpt032	Wow, you ARE a basket case, aren't you?
guycpt033	Can I talk to the nice puppet?
guycpt034	The stunningly handsome one.
guycpt035	Can I talk to the nasty puppet?
guycpt036	The one that looks like LeChuck.
guycpt037	Well, if there aren't any puppets, then why are you in a puppet theatre?
guycpt038	Ha!  Explain that!
guycpt039	What?
guycpt040	I can't believe that you live in a puppet theatre.
guycpt041	I think I'll leave you alone.
guycpt042	Could you help me find this?
guycpt043	It's a picture of the Ultimate Insult.
guycpt044	H-H-H-Hey, you forgot your puppets!
guycpt045	Gee, guess that was just the kind of breakthrough he needed to mend his shattered psyche.
guycpt046	Excuse me, ma'am.
guycpt047	This is kind of a strange place for a school.
guycpt048	Eh, uh, transmawhatification?
guycpt049	Th-that's the most nefariously evil thing I've ever heard!
guycpt050	I'm tired of being a slimy pirate.  Sign me up.
guycpt051	Do you know anything about the Ultimate Insult?
guycpt052	It's a powerful voodoo talisman that destroys peoples' egos.
guycpt053	Did you know that there's a crazy man cruising along your shore?
guycpt054	Brave?
guycpt055	He's a loon!
guycpt056	Um, bye.
guycpt057	Miss Rivers?
guycpt058	I'd like to take another whack at becoming a transmanwhatified pirate.
guycpt059	Oh, I know, but I feel a relapse coming on.
guycpt060	Arrr.  Ayyyye.  Avast, ya swabs!
guycpt061	Eh, see?
guycpt062	Yes, ma'am.  This pirate lifestyle is too physically taxing for a wimp like me.
guycpt063	Eh, but--
guycpt064	Why didn't I get a Pirate Transmoglorification Certificate?
guycpt065	Oh.
guycpt066	I'd like to reclaim a confiscated item.
guycpt067	I'm, uh, collecting it for a friend.
guycpt068	Darn.
guycpt069	What's your first name, baby?
guycpt070	Land shark!
guycpt071	I don't wanna get bit.
guycpt072	It's a rusty old anchor.
guycpt073	Too heavy.
guycpt074	Awash in sand.
guycpt075	It's half buried.
guycpt076	Its steering days are over.
guycpt077	'Knuttin' Beach: 1 kilometer'
guycpt078	'Jambalaya Island™: 3 kilometers'
guycpt079	'Wall Drug: 7,921 kilometers'
guycpt080	You can lead a cow to water...
guycpt081	No pirate would wear that!
guycpt082	It's the boat I brought from Jambalaya Island™.
guycpt083	'In case of fire, pull alarm.'
guycpt084	What's the point, NOW?
guycpt085	Never try this at home, boys and girls.
guycpt086	False fire alarms cost lives.
guycpt087	This house has no door.
guycpt088	There's no door there, just a door frame.
guycpt089	I'd look at the door if there was one.
guycpt090	Hellooo... Anyone home?
guycpt091	Nasty little fella.
guycpt092	I'm sure he'd enjoy looking at this, IF HE WASN'T A PUPPET!
guycpt093	I'm pretty sure I would get arrested for supplying alcohol to a minor.
guycpt094	Nah, I don't want to stunt his growth.
guycpt095	Puppets have no need for this.
guycpt096	Handsome little fella.
guycpt097	And I was worried that I was neurotic.
guycpt098	I doubt he'd be interested in a map to Jambalaya Island™.
guycpt099	I wonder what a sweet little old lady like that is doing in this dirty, pirate town.
guyfor001	It goes deeper into the forest.
guyfor002	It goes off into the forest.
guyfor003	I don't think I want to get lost in the forest.
guyfor004	Hmm.. the path ends here.
guyfor005	There's no way I'll be able to follow him through the forest without some sort of trail.
guygme001	What do you think you're doing?
guygme002	Yeah.
guygme003	Dead?
guygme004	Yeah!
guygme005	I know, but the stench usually drifts away with high tide.
guygme006	...although it sometimes lingers during an eclipse...
guygme007	Uh, yes, dear?
guygme008	Won't that make you a flesh-eating zombie?
guygme009	More backrubs and foot massages?
guygme010	Stop the insanity.  Check.
guygme011	Oh, but I hate talking to lawyers!
guygme012	Okay.
guygme013	She was a lot nicer before she died.
guygme014	I hope this works.
guygme015	Don't worry.  I'll love you even after rigor mortis sets in.
guygme016	What about me?  Did they say anything about me?
guygme017	That's terrible.  Did they sell any of my stuff?
guygme018	Hmmm... maybe I should run.
guygme019	Who are you?
guygme020	Wait a second...was I the pet monkey in that last sentence?
guygme021	But why?
guygme022	They are?
guygme023	He makes a lot of sense, Elaine.  I never did like those poodles.
guygme024	Really?  I thought he smelled more like a rotting corpse...
guygme025	...with maybe a hint of oregano...
guygme026	Yes, dear?
guygme027	Woo hoo!  How can I help?
guygme028	But why?  I destroyed the catapult.
guygme029	But I want to come up with clever campaign slogans and do ops research!
guygme030	What's that?
guygme031	What?
guygme032	Well, okay then, that's more like it.
guygme033	Touchy.  Geez.
guygme034	Wow.  What wonders will technology bring next?
guygme035	Aaah!
guygme036	Those control the firing of the catapult.
guygme037	Having bigger guns is always good... but this is ridiculous.
guygme038	Nothing!  I don't know what you're talking about!
guygme039	Here, I brought you some kudu jerky pretzels...
guygme040	You're welcome.  You know, you could thank me by not chucking big ol' boulders at my house.
guygme041	Want some more kudu jerky pretzels?
guygme042	Well, you could save time and thank me now by not knocking down my house with your massive balls of rock.
guygme043	(grumble)... ungrateful...
guygme044	Hm... I've run out of jerky pretzels.
guygme045	You wouldn't think a scrawny guy like that could lift those heavy boulders.
guygme046	Looks like he's got plenty of ammunition.
guygme047	That pig-shape bush frightens and confuses me.
guygme048	That is one FAT bird!
guygme049	(SQAWK)!  Polly want a fertilizer pellet?
guygme050	Hmm... looks like our landscaper has been monkeying around.
guygme051	It's a long way down.
guygme052	Okay...
guygme053	Goodbye cruel adventure game!
guygme054	Eh, forget it.
guygme055	Hey, I bet I could market this...
guygme056	Vegetarian steak!
guygme057	I wonder how these cacti got onto our tropical pirate island?
guygme058	No, I don't want cactus needles poking through my shorts.
guygme059	I KNEW it looked like a giant slingshot.
guygme060	With that inner tube, it looks like a giant slingshot.
guygme061	What an odd-looking cactus.
guygme062	As useful as a two-pronged cactus would be, I'd rather not stick one in my pants.
guygme063	Hmmm.  Not a bad piece of modern art, if I do say so myself.
guygme064	Hey, that's where I live.
guygme065	No way!  I don't wanna be inside if that guy actually gets lucky and hits the house!
guygme066	Ah, the path to our charmingly scruffy pirate island!
guygme067	Um... excuse me...
guygme068	Please stop firing boulders at my house.  It's very unnerving.
guygme069	What would it take to get you to stop flinging rocks at my house?
guygme070	Okay, how about temporarily?
guygme071	What are those numbers you're muttering?
guygme072	Could you show me how to hit the cactus?
guygme073	Aw, c'mon.  I wanna see a boulder hit the cactus!
guygme074	How would you like to join my crew of mighty pirates?
guygme075	Are you sure you can't join my crew?
guygme076	Not that I'm complaining, but why are you having such a hard time hitting my house?
guygme077	You seem like a busy man.  I'll let you return to your evil deeds.
guygme078	19...
guygme079	21...
guygme080	45...
guygme081	48...
guygme082	0... 0... 0.
guygme083	Ahh forget it.
guygme084	6...
guygme085	7...
guygme086	8...
guygme087	9...
guygme088	3...
guygme089	4...
guygme090	5...
guygme099	No, I've heard it's bad to bother rabid animals while they're eating.
guygme100	I don't think he would want an empty bowl.
guygme101	Hey there...
guygme102	Just a sec...
guygme103	That path leads back to Mêlée Town™.
guygme104	Why should I give him ANOTHER tool to fling boulders at my poor, defenseless, house?
guygmi001	Uh, sorry, honey.  This'll only take a moment.
guygmi002	You know, maybe I should look at these and figure out what they are before I bug Elaine with them.
guygmi003	Oh.  Yeah.
guygmi004	Just to be safe.
guygmi005	I need it to convince reluctant rapscallions to join my crew.
guygmi006	I think I used up all my charisma on the honeymoon.
guygmi007	I'm not sure.  I just have a hunch that a signed government contract might be useful.
guygmi008	I prefer the term 'state-sponsored incentive.'
guygmi009	I'm trying to get a crew to go to Lucre Island™.
guygmi010	And they want to be paid with government jobs.
guygmi011	Bribe is such an ugly word.  Think of it as workfare.
guygmi012	We don't own many coats in these tropical climes.
guygmi013	It's a portrait of Elaine's grandfather, Horatio T. Marley.
guygmi014	This must have been painted years before his yacht was sucked into a whirlpool off the coast of Australia twenty or so years ago, never to be seen again.
guygmi015	I don't think Elaine would appreciate me taking down her coveted family portraits.
guygmi016	How could a mere painting capture the essence of my love?
guygmi017	Yes, dear.
guygmi018	This is hardly a wallet sized picture.
guygmi019	Hey, it's Elaine as a little kid with Grandpa Marley.
guygmi020	Aww, how cute.
guygmi021	But honey, you don't have any of my baby pictures!
guygmi022	Ehh!
guygmi023	This would be great to have hanging on my wall!
guygmi024	Oh wait... it is hanging on my wall.
guygmi025	It's an old sofa.
guygmi026	I'm a pirate, not a furniture mover.
guygmi027	No, that sofa doesn't have enough lower back support.
guygmi028	Wouldn't want to end up becoming a hunchback and looking abnormal...
guygmi029	Wow, this plant is really resilient.
guygmi030	We haven't watered it since we left!
guygmi031	No way!  Pirates don't plant trees!
guygmi032	I love chess...especially the horsies.
guygmi033	I've got no time for easily-mastered games like chess.
guygmi034	Groovy banner.
guygmi035	For some reason, it makes me want to ride a hog.
guygmi036	Elaine'd kill me if I got dirt on her family banner.
guygmi037	This clock appears to be stuck at 6:10.
guygmi038	The pendulum isn't moving either.
guygmi039	(Gasp)!  Maybe we're stuck in some kind of temporal anomaly where time stands still... FOREVER!!!
guygmi040	That could work too.
guygmi041	No, it'd be stupid to carry around this clock just to keep time...
guygmi042	I mean, it's not even running!
guygmi043	I'll wind this clock after I've stopped whatever evil's afoot.
guygmi044	I can see most of Mêlée Island™ from here.
guygmi045	I could open this window, but why?
guygmi046	I like this kind of commode better than the one in the bathroom...
guygmi047	The one made of...eeeeugh...porcelain.
guygmi048	Nah, most of this stuff is Elaine's.  I wouldn't want to deprive her of her favorite trinkets.
guygmi049	Elaine really loves these plates for some reason.
guygmi050	Who's touching it?  I'm not touching it.  No sir, not me!
guygmi051	Elaine wouldn't like me touching the china while she's gone.
guygmi052	It's the door to our bedroom.  Hee hee!  Hee hee!
guygmi052a	It's the door to our bedroom, aw yeahhhhh.
guygmi053	This is no time to sleep!
guygmi054	I've heard of homes away from home, but that would be ridiculous.
guygmi055	What a strange lamp.
guygmi056	I meant 'strange' as in 'strange and wondrous.'
guygmi057	Nah, it's bright enough in here.
guygmi058	I wouldn't want Elaine to go blind.
guygmi059	Yup, it's a door.
guygmi060	Hello, my little plunder bunny.
guygmi061	Hello, Guv'nor.
guygmi062	Ahoy there, matey!
guygmi063	What was I supposed to be doing?
guygmi064	Umm, what was the plan again?
guygmi065	Did you see the way I rid us of that cataclysmic catapult?
guygmi066	I'm having a little trouble getting a ship.
guygmi067	Nobody wants to be on my crew.
guygmi068	Hey you should use that in your campaign.
guygmi069	Can I have some money?
guygmi070	I'm not sure, but it always seems as though I could use a few hundred pieces of eight on my adventures.
guygmi071	I... I blew it all gambling on spitting contests on Booty Island™.
guygmi072	Oh, shucks.
guygmi073	I really think I'll need some money on this trip.
guygmi074	I'll let you concentrate on your campaign.
guygmi075	Me too.  See you later.
guygmi076	No, I swear, I just forgot.
guygmi077	No, I swear, I just want to make sure I have the details right.
guygmi078	Maybe a little.  Is that so wrong?
guygmi079	Never mind, I remember now.
guygmi080	Sorry, Elaine, but I'm too busy to help you right now.
guygmi081	We could move away and leave this mess for someone else.
guygmi082	We could make a public offering of the island and retire on the proceeds.
guygmi083	We could launch a full scale attack on city hall.
guygmi084	Hold the town hostage, I say!  Arr!
guygmi085	My ideas are all too ahead of their time to be taken seriously.
guygmi086	I'll get right on it.
guygmi087	I can't find one.
guygmi088	Hmm, yes.  That makes sense.
guygmi089	You mean I can't just float through this adventure?
guygmi090	I don't know, I haven't even tried yet.
guygmi091	All right.
guygmi092	I don't have the authority to requisition one.
guygmi093	Can you believe that?  Me!  There must be a bunch of new people around here since we left.
guygmi094	What's this doohicky?
guygmi095	A true pirate doesn't need some 'gubernatorial symbol' to prove he commands respect.
guygmi096	Oh all right.  Oh, does this mean I get to run the island now?  I've got some revolutionary ideas about subsidized child care--
guygmi097	No problem.
guygmi098	.
guygmi099	I don't think Elaine would want an empty bowl.
guygmi100	I'm no expert, but this china doesn't seem very nice.
guygmi101	It's the door to the kitchen.
guygmi102	I would, but for some reason, Elaine has locked it up.
guygmi103	Elaine?
guygmi104	Want a kudu jerky pretzel?
guygmi105	I've always wondered what was behind the mansion.  Now I know.
guygom001	It's too small.  Maybe if I were a monkey I could fit.
guygom002	He got the banana!
guygom003	Here monkey monkey monkey!
guygom004	The opening is smaller now.
guygom005	The vent is fully open again.
guygom006	It's dark in there, but I can see the latch for the door.
guygom007	It's dark in there, but I can see the latch for the door, and a hungry-looking monkey.
guygom008	It's dark in there, but I can see the latch for the door, and a banana on the floor.
guygom009	There's already one in there.
guygom010	Ugh, I can't reach the latch.
guygom011	It's a big metal door.
guygom012	There's no way to open the door from this side.
guygom013	That worked like a charm!
guygom014	There sure are a lot of roots growing through this ceiling.
guygom015	Without those roots, there'd be only sky left.
guygom016	I don't think I could pull those plants down through the ceiling.
guygom017	I can see the sky!
guygom018	It opens and closes the vent.
guygom019	Nothing is going in or out of that vent while it's closed.
guygom020	It's an open vent of some sort.
guygom021	It's a closed vent of some sort.
guygom022	I can't put a banana in there, the vent is closed.
guygom023	I wonder if this barrel would explode if I shot it.
guygom024	I don't have anything to shoot with.
guygom025	It can't be safe to store cloth sacks of gunpowder so close to open flames.
guygom026	Those look too heavy to be carrying around.
guygom027	It's the lever that controls the track switch.
guygom028	It's probably stuck.
guygom029	There's a hole in this bucket.
guygom030	No, it's got a hole in it.
guygom031	Hmm.. what could be behind this wall of boards.
guygom032	It's boarded up, I'll never get through there.
guygom033	It's a pouch.
guygom034	It looks pretty useless.
guygom035	This mine car seems to have wandered from the tracks.
guygom036	It's broken.
guygom037	That leads back to the canyon.
guygom038	That leads to the engine of the monkey-head machine.
guygom039	That leads down into that room with all the machinery.
guygom040	I wonder where that goes.
guygom041	That didn't accomplish anything.
guygom042	There's no way I'll be able to fit through that portal.
guygpt001	Pardon me.
guygpt002	What kind of a pirate are you?
guygpt003	You're pretty brave for a tourist.
guygpt004	Most tourists would steer clear of pirate-infested islands.
guygpt005	What would you say if I told you that *I* was one of those 'undesirable' pirate elements?
guygpt006	I think I've just been insulted.
guygpt007	No, really, I AM a grog-swilling, sword-waving reprobate, honest!
guygpt008	That's a great ensemble.
guygpt009	Um, yeah.
guygpt010	Do you know where I can find the pieces of the Ultimate Insult?
guygpt011	No, it's a dangerous voodoo talisman of inexplicably soul-crunching power!
guygpt012	Its pieces are supposed to be somewhere on Jambalaya Island™.
guygpt013	Can I pick your brain some more about the Ultimate Insult?
guygpt014	What are you doing?
guygpt015	Can't take your eyes off the statue, can you?
guygpt016	Sorry to bother you.
guygpt017	One of the pieces looks like a golden man.
guygpt018	One of the pieces looks like a bronze pirate hat.
guygpt019	Why?
guygpt020	Do you really think the bronze hat I'm looking for could've come from this statue?
guygpt021	One of the pieces looks like a silver monkey head.
guygpt022	I've had just about enough talking about the Ultimate Insult for now.
guygpt023	What made Tiny so famous?
guygpt024	Was there really a Tiny LaFeet, or was he dreamed up by someone's marketing department?
guygpt025	What happened to the top of the statue?
guygpt026	It looks like someone gave Tiny a bad haircut.
guygpt027	All that stuff about 'Tiny, the Friendly Pirate' is a big fat lie.
guygpt028	The REAL Tiny LaFeet was a nasty, murderous lout.
guygpt029	I'd rather not talk about Tiny right now.
guygpt030	Welcome to Jambalaya Island™, home of swashbuckling pirates and spooooky voodoo curses!
guygpt031	What are you guys talking about? This is a perfectly normal pirate town...
guygpt032	...that's been completely taken over by the corporate tourist industry.
guygpt033	Gee, Ozzie must've been really busy here.
guygpt034	Mister Cheese!
guygpt035	Raise the anchor, hoist the sails, and ready the warp drive!
guygpt036	Otis!
guygpt037	Go find Carla, and sober her up!
guygpt038	Now that the pieces of the Ultimate Insult are mine, it's back to Mêlée Island™!
guygpt039	Ahoy there, Mister Cheese!
guygpt040	Assemble the crew, Mister Cheese, we're shoving off!
guygpt041	Why not?
guygpt042	I guess.  But I really wanted to go for a cruise.
guygpt043	Darn.
guygpt044	Are you going to be taking any shore leave?
guygpt045	Why?
guygpt046	Where's Carla?
guygpt047	It looks like a produce cart exploded on your arms.
guygpt048	Carla's drunk!
guygpt049	Depressed?
guygpt050	Want to help me find the pieces of the Ultimate Insult?
guygpt051	Carry on, Mister Cheese.
guygpt052	It's still Otis.
guygpt053	I'm starting to have my doubts about his navigational skills.
guygpt054	He sure seems taken by that statue.
guygpt055	It looks almost seaworthy.
guygpt056	Hey, it's Murray!
guygpt057	Maybe not, but this stool looks like it spins...
guygpt058	How'd you like to have a liver again?
guygpt059	No, I don't think so.
guygpt060	Hey, Murray, I brought you some feet.  Now you can walk around again.
guygpt061	Well, you don't seem to be moving from that stool much.
guygpt062	So, what's today's special in your evil domain?
guygpt063	Any interest in a prosthetic stomach?
guygpt064	Yikes.
guygpt065	Murray... Look what I've got for you.
guygpt066	I bet you could find an evil use for these.
guygpt067	Here, have a heart.
guygpt068	Care for a drink?
guygpt069	Here, this might help keep you awake on duty.
guygpt070	I guess you don't need it, then.
guygpt071	Hungry?
guygpt072	He'd only use it for evil.
guygpt073	I guess that leaves more bagel for me.
guygpt074	I think she's done all she can with this painting.
guygpt075	Or is that 'to this painting?'
guygpt076	I can't get it from here.  There's a window pane in the way.
guygpt077	What a jolly-looking statue...
guygpt078	...but it looks like someone's taken a crowbar to its head.
guygpt079	It's a statue of the Bowlderized Tiny LaFeet.
guygpt080	'Tiny LaFeet - Cuius Praeda Est?'
guygpt081	Dangit.  More Latin.  Now I wish I had bought that 'Latin for Scummies' book.
guygpt082	Hello street lamp.
guygpt083	'Keep Out - Private Beach'
guygpt084	Eh... no thanks.  I had my fill of private beaches in my last adventure.
guygpt085	Canoes for rent.
guygpt086	I don't have any money to rent these canoes.
guygpt087	'Welcome to Jambalaya Island™.'
guygpt088	That sign is REALLY high in the air.
guygpt089	Oh my gosh.  That's a Plexus LVX300 limited edition luxury yacht!  Talk about glitzy.
guygpt090	As much as I'd love to steal this ship, I have more important things to do.
guygpt091	I can't seem to get the hang of volleyball.
guygpt092	The ball keeps smacking me in the face and knocking me out.
guygpt093	Piraci nie bawi¹ siê w siatkówke(TEST)
guygpt094	Of course, the hooks and eyepatches tend them to keep them away from most sports that place an emphasis on inflatable balls and acute depth perception.
guygpt095	'StarBuccaneer's™ Coffee', home of expensive espressos and gentrified java.
guygpt096	'Micro-Groggery.'
guygpt097	Personally, I prefer the macro-sized grogs.
guygpt098	OOooooh.  Pretty flowers.
guygpt099	I don't think these flowers are going to get me any closer to assembling the Ultimate Insult.
guygpt100	Looks like this particular storefront hasn't been moved into yet.
guygpt101	The sign says: 'Coming soon: JumboJuice Frozen Fruit Smoothies'.
guygpt102	'Added nutrients give you energy boosts (and helps prevent scurvy in 99% of pirates age 2 and above!)'
guygpt103	Oh sure, just put a big ol' barrel of free Monkey Mug Meal coupons out AFTER I go through all this trouble to get some.
guygpt104	I think I'll just take one at a time.
guygpt105	This door goes into the Micro-Groggery.
guygpt106	That door goes into the StarBuccaneer's™.
guygpt107	That door goes into Planet Threepwood.
guygpt108	That leads out to the island.
guygpt109	'Community Rowboat.'
guygpt110	'Disclaimer:  The Jambalaya Island™ Chamber of Commerce cannot be held responsible for the seaworthiness of the Community Rowboat.'
guyhei001	I'll just put the Gubernatorial Symbol here...
guyhei002	Hey!  This place looks like some sort of control room.
guyhei003	I wonder what all this stuff does?
guyhei004	Who knew a giant monkey head could be so complicated?
guyhei005	It looks like something important is supposed to go in there.
guyhei006	I can't imagine that this actually steers anything.
guyhei007	Steer the giant monkey head?  That just sounds so wrong.
guyhei008	They look like controls of some sort.
guyhei009	Nothing happened.
guyhei010	Let's see... temperature, pressure, monkeys...
guyhei011	They all read zero.
guyhei012	The temperature and pressure seem to be rising.
guyhei013	Nice view of the clearing from here.
guyhei014	I'm looking, I'm looking.
guyhei015	That leads back outside.
guyhei016	It looks like something fits in there.
guyhei017	There appear to be a bunch of valves and pressure lines running into this control panel.
guyhei018	Didn't do anything.
guyhei019	I can hear some bubbling noises coming from in there.
guyhei020	I hope the Monkey Head isn't getting gas.
guyhei021	It's quiet.  There doesn't seem to be any pressure buildup.
guyhei022	Lots of random gizmos.  I probably shouldn't touch those.
guyhei023	Lots of random unlabeled buttons.  Somebody needs to learn some user interface design theory.
guyhei024	Looks like an interior designer must've been trapped on the island at one time.
guyhei025	Better not.
guyhei026	This must be the Captain's chair.  It's got an arm rest control pad thing.
guyhei027	Starfish date 182.43.  The gamma quadrant has no monkeys.
guyhei028	I think I'm supposed to put something in there.
guyhei029	No, that doesn't fit right.
guyhei030	Hey!  It fits!
guyhei031	Hmm... the temperature and monkey gauges both read zero.  I guess I need to fill those up, first.
guyhei032	The temperature gauge reads zero.  I guess it could use some heat.
guyhei033	The gauge marked 'monkeys' reads zero.  I guess I need some monkeys.
guyhoj001	Ohh Inspector!
guyhoj002	I think you'll find this interesting.
guyhoj003	You bet it is!
guyhoj004	I think you'll find it goes with the nose I gave you earlier.
guyhoj005	Oh, did I mention that I found it with the loot that was stolen from the bank?
guyhoj006	Here.  This should be sufficient to clear my name and get this wretched anklet removed.
guyhoj007	That's right, and it's the screw that attaches Pegnose's prosthetic nose to his face!
guyhoj008	Gee, inspector, you run a tight ship.  Almost as tight as this anklet.
guyhoj009	I'll be back.
guyhoj010	Well, Inspector, here's your real criminal!
guyhoj011	It is!  He's the one who framed me for the bank robbery.
guyhoj012	I'd like this anklet removed now.
guyhoj013	I overheard you and Ozzie talking about how he hired you to rob the bank and frame me!
guyhoj014	That prosthetic nose I gave you earlier should clear my name.
guyhoj015	But...
guyhoj016	Well, not exactly...
guyhoj017	But you can't just let him go!
guyhoj018	(Sigh).  All right.
guyhoj019	It's Pegnose.
guyhoj020	It's Otis.
guyhoj021	That's Inspector Canard.
guyhoj022	Iron Maiden!  Excellent!
guyhoj023	Uh, I have no idea why I said that.
guyhoj024	I'm not getting in there!
guyhoj025	Not after what happened last time.
guyhoj026	Now THERE'S a manly pirate.
guyhoj027	It's attached to the wall.
guyhoj028	Hey, I should bring Meathook here.  He'd like this place.
guyhoj029	It's good to see that Lucre Island™ doesn't mollycoddle its criminal element.
guyhoj030	My mom told me not to play with sharp, pointy objects.
guyhoj031	Especially the ones with other people's blood on them.
guyhoj032	It says 'Contra Leges Marinas Latrocinium maris est.'
guyhoj033	Eh, I think that means...
guyhoj034	Actually, I have no idea what it means.
guyhoj035	I think that means 'Seize the day.'
guyhoj036	I think that means 'Buyer beware.'
guyhoj037	I think that means 'No smoking.'
guyhoj038	I think that means 'Authorized personnel only.'
guyhoj039	I think that means 'Privacy is against the law of the sea.'
guyhoj040	I think that means 'Piracy is the law of the sea.'
guyhoj041	I think that means 'Do not feed the prisoners.'
guyhoj042	It's a slimy old crawdaddy trap with a slimy old criminal in it.
guyhoj043	No, I think I'll leave Pegnose here where the authorities can deal with him properly.
guyhoj044	It's the exit.
guyhoj045	Inspector?
guyhoj046	I'm innocent!  It was the no-nosed pirate that robbed the bank!
guyhoj047	So, what you're saying is that you don't believe me.
guyhoj048	Why don't you believe that Pegnose Pete robbed the bank?
guyhoj049	Just for the sake of argument, what would it take to prove my innocence?
guyhoj050	Great!  Uh, how do I do that?
guyhoj051	That should be a piece of cake for a pirate with a keen analytical mind like myself.
guyhoj052	How do I go about proving my innocence, again?
guyhoj053	Oh, yeah.
guyhoj054	Ozzie Mandrill hired Pegnose Pete to set me up!
guyhoj055	I overheard them talking about it!
guyhoj056	Can you remove this voodoo anklet?  I really need to get back to my wife.
guyhoj057	When can I expect my trial?
guyhoj058	Great.  When's that?
guyhoj059	A few weeks!? I need to get back to Mêlée Island™ TODAY!
guyhoj060	But I'm innocent!
guyhoj061	Wow, this voodoo anklet sure is uncomfortable.
guyhoj062	I guess it's not so bad after all, heh.
guyhoj063	How's the investigation going?
guyhoj064	Oh.
guyhoj065	You're not going to lift a finger to help me, are you?
guyhoj066	But what about justice?
guyhoj067	Not to mention lazy, apparently.
guyhoj068	I caught the real thief, can I go now?
guyhoj069	I recovered the stolen loot, am I free now?
guyhoj070	But I caught Pegnose Pete!
guyhoj071	Where can I find Pegnose Pete?
guyhoj072	Because he framed me for robbing the bank?
guyhoj074	Well, I better get out there and prove my innocence.
guyhoj075	How's it going, Otis?
guyhoj076	Otis!  What are you doing here?
guyhoj077	Let me guess, you were framed, right?
guyhoj078	Ehh, just a hunch.
guyhoj079	When are you due to be released?
guyhoj080	Otis.
guyhoj081	You're not helping.
guyhoj082	What is it with you and flowers?
guyhoj083	If it's any comfort, Otis, I never found you all that fearsome to begin with.
guyhoj084	I'm feeling an incredible feeling of deja vu.
guyhoj085	Wait, it's passed.
guyhoj086	Has Pegnose said anything interesting?
guyhoj087	Yeah!
guyhoj088	Great.
guyhoj089	See ya later, Otis.
guyhoj090	Hi, Otis.
guyhoj091	Where's Carla?
guyhoj092	Carla's drunk!
guyhoj093	Why aren't you with Carla?
guyhoj094	Do you want me to get you anything from town?
guyhoj095	I don't suppose you've got any useful thoughts about the Ultimate Insult?
guyhoj096	Will you try to stay out of trouble this time?
guyhoj097	I shudder to think.
guyhoj098	Carry on.
guyhoj099	How about a half-decaf, half-caf triple cappuccino mocha latte from StarBuccaneers™?
guyhoj100	Like grog, Otis?
guyhoj101	How about a custom-brewed boysenberry grog from the Micro-Groggery?
guyhoj102	Why not?
guyhoj103	Good point.
guyhoj104	How about some authentic souvenirs from Planet Threepwood?
guyhoj105	Well, I saw some lovely flowers at the edge of the docks.
guyhoj106	Y'know, I can't think of anything you'd want, either.
guyhoj107	Well, if it isn't Pegnose Pete, the Pilfering Pirate.
guyhoj108	So, the infamous Pegnose Pete finally meets his match.
guyhoj109	I want my belongings, and I want them now!
guyhoj110	Tell me where my stuff is and I won't hurt you.
guyhoj111	This is your last chance to tell me where the loot is.
guyhoj112	C'mon... Please tell me where the loot is.
guyhoj113	How does Ozzie Mandrill fit into this scheme?
guyhoj114	Yes you do.  I saw him over at your house.
guyhoj115	I am not!  I'm mightier than you'll ever be!
guyhoj116	Did a duck really nibble off your nose?
guyhoj117	QUACK!
guyhoj118	I bet you didn't realize that you smell like a combination of swamp water, sawdust, fish bait and flowers.
guyhoj119	Why would someone with no nose need a hanky?
guyhoj120	You know, we actually do look kind of similar...
guyhoj121	...except I'm not chained to the wall.
guyhoj122	Stay here.  I'm off to enjoy my freedom.
guyhoj123	Or I'll bring my duck in here.
guyhoj124	Or I'll boil ya in oil!
guyhoj125	Or you'll be wishin' it was just your nose that was missing!
guyhoj126	Or I'll ask you again!
guyhoj127	Or I'll start singing show tunes.
guyhoj128	Ewww.
guyhoj129	Or nothing.
guyhoj130	Crystal.  Ulp.
guyhoj131	It's a stinky hanky that belongs to the REAL bank robber!
guyhoj132	He's already a bit of a butthead... no need to rub his face in it.
guyhoj133	Recognize THIS, Pegnose?
guyhoj134	Want a flower, Otis?
guyhoj135	This jail door looks sturdier than the one in the bank.
guyhoj136	This grog isn't strong enough to eat through the bars...
guyhoj137	Besides which, I really don't think I should be trying to bust people out of jail right now.
guyhoj138	That seems like a good idea...
guyhoj139	But I've got a hunch that I'm going to need this hanky to...
guyhos001	Um, just looking at my stuff.
guyhos002	Slightly irregular and blemished sticks - 40 percent off marked price.
guyhos003	These sticks look perfectly fine to me.
guyhos004	Nah, I'm not exactly sure what's wrong with them.
guyhos005	'It is very important to choose a walking stick that fits your body, lifestyle, and temperament...'
guyhos006	'Your walking stick should be no more than waist high, and hefty enough to support fifty percent of your body weight...'
guyhos007	'Active people should choose a stick that corresponds with the type of activity...'
guyhos008	... BORING.
guyhos009	I guess I don't want a walking stick THAT bad.
guyhos010	Still a barrel of sticks.
guyhos011	It's a barrel of sticks.
guyhos012	Just another barrel of sticks.
guyhos013	Sticks, just like every other barrel here.
guyhos014	There's so many to choose from, I can't decide.
guyhos015	I don't think there are any sticks I want in that barrel.
guyhos016	What does it take to get some service in here?
guyhos017	It's Freddie's Stick Catalog.
guyhos018	Why would I wanna look through the catalog, when I've got the real thing right here?
guyhos019	This must be Freddie's calculator.
guyhos020	Pirates don't need calculators.
guyhos021	Those little buggers sure know high quality wood when they see it.
guyhos022	That won't do much good.
guyhos023	It's Freddie the stick maker.
guyhos024	Must be the guy who makes these sticks.
guyhos025	But you're a peaceable sort, right?
guyhos026	Yeah, those are funny.
guyhos027	Hey!
guyhos028	It's the door.
guyhos029	I'm back!
guyhos030	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate!
guyhos031	What's your racket?
guyhos032	I wouldn't think that a walking stick shop could support itself on a pirate-infested island.
guyhos033	So, the walking stick market is booming, is that it?
guyhos034	Eh, can you help me?  I can't decide which walking stick is right for me.
guyhos035	I'd like to take another whack at choosing the perfect walking stick.
guyhos036	You wouldn't happen to know anything about a no-nosed pirate, would ya?
guyhos037	Could you tell me anything else about Pegnose Pete?
guyhos038	Why do you put up with that rude, stick-breaking customer?
guyhos039	Anything else that you'd like to tell me about Mister Mandrill?
guyhos040	Stick around.  I'll be back later.
guyhos041	Who is he?
guyhos042	No!
guyhos043	Gosh.  What did you do?
guyhos044	And?
guyhos045	Fascinating.
guyhos046	So, who is Pegnose, again?
guyhos047	Oh yeah, right.
guyhos048	Where can I find him?
guyhos049	Come again?
guyhos050	Where did you say I could find Pegnose?
guyhos051	Oh.  Yeah.
guyhos052	What happened to his nose?
guyhos053	Ewww.
guyhos054	Why not?
guyhos055	Good point.
guyhos056	So, you really don't think that a duck bit off his nose?
guyhos057	Why is he trying to frame me?
guyhos058	On second thought, I think I'll find out about Pegnose on my own.
guyhos059	Along sun-swept Caribbean beaches.
guyhos060	Amidst dense Caribbean jungles.
guyhos061	Back and forth on the deck of my mighty pirate ship.
guyhos062	From the couch to the kitchen and back.
guyhos063	Walking?  I thought these things were just decorative!
guyhos064	I'll probably be by myself.
guyhos065	I'll be walking with my wife.
guyhos066	She's a governor, you know.
guyhos067	It'll just be me and a few close friends.
guyhos068	I prefer walking in large groups.
guyhos069	Let me get back to ya on that.
guyhos070	Three minutes.
guyhos071	About a half-hour.  Forty-five minutes, tops.
guyhos072	Eight hours, twenty-three minutes, thirty-seven seconds.
guyhos073	Forty days and forty nights.
guyhos074	Um, no.
guyhos075	Gee, there's a surprise.
guyhos076	Hey, isn't that what you told me the LAST time?
guyhos077	I don't really think that's any of your business.
guyhos078	All the termites have already jumped ship onto the cane.
guyhos079	It's bad form to grease someone else's walking stick without permission.
guyhos080	That's a good idea, but I don't think these are the right sticks to sabotage.
guyjam001	Aiiee!
guyjam002	Now THAT'S a pirate town!
guyjam003	It's a little rocky beach.
guyjam004	It's a ship of crazies.
guyjam005	That's a REALLY tall rock formation.
guyjam006	That's that pirate-lite town I arrived at.
guyjam007	Stan's time share.
guyjam008	It's a beach littered with boulders.
guyjam009	Eh... too rocky.
guyjam010	It's Jambalaya Island's™ plank diving competition area.
guyjam011	It's a big coast guard ship.
guyjam012	It's a gaudy-looking house.
guyjam013	It's the community rowboat I borrowed.
guyjun001	That goes back to Monkey Island™.
guykab001	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate.
guykab002	And you are...?
guykab003	I'm back!
guykab004	Where'd that cannonball come from?
guykab005	I forgot:  WHY does Casaba fire his cannons at you?
guykab006	Are you aware that you've got a pair of parrots on your shoulders?
guykab007	Was that sarcasm?
guykab008	You're joking.
guykab009	You're not joking.
guykab010	Which parrot's Huggyn, and which one's Kyssin?
guykab011	(I can't believe I just asked that.)
guykab012	Why?
guykab013	Special how?
guykab014	Which parrot always tells the truth?
guykab015	You're awfully large.
guykab016	I'm looking for the pieces of the Ultimate Insult.
guykab017	It's an ancient voodoo talisman of butt-numbingly incredible power.
guykab018	Jumbeaux LaFeet...any relation to Tiny LaFeet?
guykab019	I'd like to talk some more about your father.
guykab020	Don't get up, I'll see myself out.
guykab021	Was he really called 'Tiny, the Friendly Pirate?'
guykab022	If Tiny was such a great pirate, then what's with the 'Tiny, the Friendly Pirate' statue?
guykab023	Those jerks!
guykab024	Are you sure you weren't adopted?
guykab025	After all, you're so big, and Tiny was so...tiny.
guykab026	She was a large woman, I take it?
guykab027	So?
guykab028	Ewww.
guykab029	What happened to Tiny's Statue?
guykab030	Come again?
guykab031	Your father would've been proud of your pirate-y prowess.
guykab032	One pirate to another, where DID you bury your father's bronze hat?
guykab033	What?
guykab034	Argh.
guykab035	If I find your father's hat, can I borrow it?
guykab036	I'm going to use it to crush Ozzie Mandrill like a bug!
guykab037	I found the rock your father's hat is buried under!
guykab038	So, do you wanna help me move the rock?
guykab039	Oh, rats, now I'll have to find some other way of getting rid of that rock.
guykab040	This is obviously a painful subject.  Let's talk about something else.
guykab041	Do they sing light operas?
guykab042	How so?
guykab043	Do they fire pistols with their beaks?
guykab044	Do they solve crimes?
guykab045	Do they have a learning disability?
guykab046	Hi there!
guykab047	Uh, what's the matter?
guykab048	Gee, thanks.
guykab049	Now, boys...
guykab050	Amoral lout!
guykab051	Unemployed layabout!
guykab052	Guys?
guykab053	Uncultured corpse!!
guykab054	Uh, I really think that's loud enough to catch Casaba's attention...
guykab055	JERK!!!
guykab056	NIMROD!!!
guykab057	Sigh, I've obviously got some deep-seated issues to work out here...
guykab058	MORON!!!
guykab059	Hi there, Lil' Guybrush!
guykab060	Hi there, Big Guybrush!
guykab061	Hi there, Lil' LeChuck!
guykab062	What's on your mind, Lil' Guybrush?
guykab063	What's on your mind, Lil' LeChuck?
guykab064	I think Admiral Casaba's a big dope, don't you?
guykab065	Oh, I don't know, Lil' Guybrush.  What do you think, Lil' LeChuck?
guykab066	I think Ozzie Mandrill's an evil meanie.
guykab067	I think that's a bit harsh, Lil' Guybrush.  What do you think, Lil' LeChuck?
guykab068	I think Lil' LeChuck's a smelly undead creep.
guykab069	I can hardly argue with that, Lil' Guybrush.  What do you think, Lil' LeChuck?
guykab070	I think you should be keelhauled until the flesh is ripped from your body!
guykab071	Gosh, that's not very nice.  What do ya think of that, Lil' Guybrush?
guykab072	I think that someday Lil' Elaine will be mine!
guykab073	Gee, I didn't even know there was a Lil' Elaine.  What do you think, Lil' Guybrush?
guykab074	I think Lil' Guybrush is a big wussy!
guykab075	Jeepers, Lil' LeChuck, that's just mean.  What do you think, Lil' Guybrush?
guykab076	I think Lil' LeChuck should worry less about his enemies, and more about his personal hygiene!
guykab077	Yeah!
guykab078	I think Lil' LeChuck can kiss my woolly butt!
guykab079	I think Lil' LeChuck is, clinically speaking, a nutjob!
guykab080	I think Lil' Guybrush wouldn't know a real pirate if it stabbed him in the liver!
guykab081	Oh yeah?
guykab082	I think Lil' Guybrush should learn to sleep with one ping-pong ball eye open!
guykab083	I think Lil' Guybrush is a preening pirate wannabe!
guykab084	Pretty Polly.
guykab085	LeChuck sucks!
guykab086	Two Plus Two?
guykab087	That must've been the truth-telling parrot.
guykab088	That must've been the lying parrot
guykab089	What's my name?
guykab090	Who's your daddy?
guykab091	What are you?
guykab092	What's the capitol of North Dakota?
guykab093	Are you the parrot that always tells the truth?
guykab094	I don't think that told me anything.
guykab095	Are you the parrot that always lies?
guykab096	Is Tiny LaFeet's hat buried under this rock?
guykab097	I'm sure that was useful, but I'm not sure how.
guykab098	If only I could tells these birds apart.
guykab099	Hmm, I know that that parrot always tells the truth, so...
guykab100	Hmm, I know that parrot always lies, so...
guykab101	Tiny LaFeet's hat must be buried under THIS ROCK!
guykab102	Which way should I go to find Tiny's hat?
guykab103	Are you aware that there were two parrots on your shoulders?
guykab104	Tiny LaFeet's hat must not be here.
guykab105	He's twice the pirate I am...literally.
guykab106	That's Jumbeaux LaFeet, last of the LaFeet pirates.
guykab107	It's a parrot.
guykab108	It's a drunk parrot.
guykab109	It's a hyperactive parrot.
guykab110	I think he's tipsy enough.
guykab111	I think he's caffeinated enough.
guykab112	If my clever use of the parrots was correct, the bronze hat is under this immense rock.
guykab113	I'm not even remotely mighty enough to pick that up.
guykab114	There's got to be a better way to get under there...
guykab115	North.
guykab116	South.
guykab117	That way leads back to the campfire.
guykab118	West.
guykab119	East.
guykab120	There's nothing in that direction but impenetrable jungle.
guykab121	Holy Jumping Monkeys, that's a lot of boulders...
guykab122	How am I ever going to find the right one?
guykab123	That way leads back to the rest of Knuttin Atoll.
guykab124	I guess the parrots lost interest...
guykab125	I found your father's hat!
guykab126	Thanks for letting me borrow it...I'll try to return it to you in one piece.
guykab127	This guy looks pretty big.  I'm surprised he needs a fire to keep him warm.
guykab128	That Casaba guy almost killed me... again!
guykab129	I don't think so.  It looks really heavy.
guykit001	So what are you gonna do tomorrow night?
guykit002	The same thing we do every night...
guykit003	TRY TO TAKE OVER THE CARIBBEAN!!
guykit004	Ewww, no way!
guykit005	Who knows what kind of crevices it's been in!
guykit006	I didn't know they used pineapple in sushi dishes.
guykit007	Nah, I've had enough citric acid for a while.
guykit008	If this was bigger, it would make a REALLY boring water slide.
guykit009	Hmm... fishy.
guykit010	I'm not touching someone else's food.
guykit011	I wonder if all French chefs are issued pictures of the Eiffel Tower when they travel abroad.
guykit012	Sharp.
guykit013	I don't think carrying loose knives in my pockets is really a good idea.
guykit014	It's a pot full of fishy liquid.
guykit015	(sniff) (sniff)
guykit016	Smells like my laundry.
guykit017	I don't wanna get fish stew stains on my pants.
guykit018	To make the LuaBar special Alligator Roll, take two slices raw alligator ...
guykit019	Ugh...
guykit020	That's pretty gross.
guykit021	I don't want that recipe...Elaine might get her hands on it.
guykit022	Mmmmm.... Waaarm...
guykit023	I don't wanna burn myself.
guykit024	I wonder what kind of yummy goodies are baking in there?
guykit025	Hmmm.  Brass Monkey.
guykit026	Hmm... I'll bet you could fit a body in these sacks.
guykit027	I don't think I'll be baking any pastries anytime soon.
guykit028	That door leads back to the LUA Bar.
guykit029	Looking for a menu.  What are the specials?
guykit030	I was just looking for the bathroom...
guykit031	I... I think I lost my tour group.
guykit032	Health Inspector.  We have to have a talk about sanitation.
guykit033	Okay, okay.  I'm leaving!
guykit034	Hmmm...
guykit035	I don't think I should add that to the soup...I could end up poisoning someone.
guylag001	Good thing I had that trail to follow.
guylag002	Up until now, that is.  It's disappeared.
guylag003	Those termites probably ran out of cane to eat.
guylag004	Now, where did that Australian pirate-phobe go?
guylag005	Oh, there he is.
guylag006	Be vewy vewy quiet.  I'm hunting ozzies.
guylag007	The heirlooms must be nearby.
guylag008	It's pretty shallow here.  I can see the dirt on the bottom easily.
guylag009	Eh, no thanks.  I'm not thirsty.
guylag010	It's not so shallow here.  I can just make out the bottom.
guylag011	It's really deep here.  I can't see the bottom at all, just a strange murky darkness.
guylag012	They're very tropical.
guylag013	Ack.  No way.  I think I've had enough caber tossing to last me a while.
guylag014	That leads back to Lucre Island™.
guylag015	Hey, there's a hidden passage back here!
guylag016	That must be where Ozzie disappeared to.
guylag017	That's the way to Pegnose's ill-gotten booty showroom.
guylag018	As tempting as it is to set my ducky free, I think I'll hold onto him for a while.
guylav001	It leads to the rest of the island.
guylav002	YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
guylav003	The tree is lying right across the stream of lava, making a makeshift bridge.
guylav004	You know, this tree doesn't look very stable.  Looks lonely too.
guylav005	Maybe I should just put it out of its misery.
guylav006	Wow, that tree just fell right over!
guylav007	I hope that bridge has a high melting point.
guylav008	I could just WALK over it...
guylav009	There's a pool of lava here, with some amazingly heat-resistant weeds sticking out.
guylav010	There's a big empty ditch over there, with a bunch of strange looking weeds at the bottom.
guylav011	It's not the kind of pool you'd really want to dive into.
guylav012	I can't do that without burning myself.
guylav013	Back the lava goes.. back to the earth from whence it came.
guylav014	There's no way I can reach the bottom of that ditch from this boat.
guylav015	The rock is diverting the lava into that big ditch.
guylav016	I have the power of GreyMonkey!
guylav017	It leads to the rest of the island.
guylav018	I've already used the Weed Whipper to whip the weeds.
guylav019	It's hot molten lava streaming all over this area.
guylav020	Um, no, I'm not quite frustrated enough to jump into a stream of molten lava just yet.
guylav021	All the lava is seeping into the ground, now that all the heat-resistant weeds have been whipped.
guylaw001	Um, excuse me.  Is this...
guylaw002	I was told you guys could help me.
guylaw003	Uh, no.  I need you to see if you can save my house from being destroyed.
guylaw004	Did I mention that my house is the Governor's Mansion on Mêlée Island™?
guylaw005	I'm here representing the honorable Elaine Marley-Threepwood, Governor of the Tri-Island Area.
guylaw006	She's my wife.
guylaw007	I'm serious.  We just got back from our honeymoon...
guylaw008	...three glorious months on the high seas...
guylaw009	...and returned to find the mansion under siege by a dastardly demolitionist!
guylaw010	Wouldn't you rather go after the big bucks?
guylaw011	If Elaine wins the election, she'll be a powerful person.
guylaw012	And if the mansion is saved, she'll have someone to thank.
guylaw013	And if that someone is you...
guylaw014	Mmm... I don't know... you handled Grandpa Marley's estate, right?
guylaw015	Did he have a plan for such a crisis?
guylaw016	Okay.  I'll wait.
guylaw017	Um, I guess so.
guylaw018	What is it?
guylaw019	For a bunch of high priced lawyers, their furniture leaves something to be desired.
guylaw020	If I took it, their clients wouldn't have anything to sit on.
guylaw021	I wonder what's inside all these barrels.
guylaw022	As much as I'd like to know what's inside, the lawyers would probably prosecute me to the fullest extent of the law.
guylaw023	Hmm... let's see what's inside...
guylaw024	Ah... oops, sorry.
guylaw025	I thought there were complimentary mints inside.
guylaw026	'Whipp'
guylaw027	'Thrawtle'
guylaw028	'Digg'
guylaw029	'Law Practice For Dummies'
guylaw030	'The Law of the Sea'
guylaw031	'Statutes and Regulations of Lucre Island™'
guylaw032	'Practicing Law in the Company of Pirates and other Swarthy-types'
guylaw033	'Confusion Through Obscusion'
guylaw034	'Fifty Ways to Sue Your Ex-Lover'
guylaw035	'To Kill a Mockingbird...And Get it Reduced to Manslaughter'
guylaw036	'Pirates are from Mars, Lawyers are from Uranus'
guylaw037	'Inherent the Wind II: The Monkeys Seek Damages'
guylaw038	'Everything I Know About Lawyering I Learned In Kindergarten'
guylaw039	'The Ambulance Chaser's Guide to the Tri-Island Area'
guylaw040	That seems to be all of the interesting books.
guylaw041	As interested as I am in law practice, eh, I don't have much time for reading these days.
guylaw042	Judging by their name tags, this is Whipp, Thrawtle, and Digg.
guylaw043	It's a door.
guylaw044	Um--
guylaw045	Have you guys figured out how to save my mansion yet?
guylaw046	Hey, according to Grandpa Marley's letter, the deed's here on Lucre Island™, at the local bank!
guylaw047	Um, no.
guylaw048	Um, I did, but--
guylaw049	A no-nosed pirate stole it from me, and framed me for bank robbery!
guylaw050	Gee, that's a coincidence.
guylaw051	Well, Grandpa Marley's letter mentioned something about the deed being in the Lucre Island™ Bank,
guylaw052	So I went over to get it.
guylaw053	And, while I was there, a no-nosed pirate robbed the bank, stole the deed, and framed me for bank robbery.
guylaw054	No thanks.  I trust the courts to recognize my inherent innocence.
guylaw055	Gee, maybe I should go find it.
guylaw056	I'd like to sue someone.
guylaw057	I'd still like to sue someone.
guylaw058	Why don't sharks eat lawyers?
guylaw059	What do you call a galleon full of lawyers at the bottom of the ocean?
guylaw060	A good start!
guylaw061	What's the difference between a lawyer and the Ghost Pirate LeChuck?
guylaw062	Eh... no, no, no.  One is an undead, demonic plunderer, while the other's just LeChuck.
guylaw063	Did you hear the one about the pirate who kidnapped a dozen lawyers?
guylaw064	No, no, he threatened to release one every hour until his demands were met.
guylaw065	How can you tell when a lawyer is lying?
guylaw066	Actually, you just check to see if his lips are moving.
guylaw067	Did you hear the one about the lawyer who sued to get into Paradise?
guylaw068	Wow, this is a tough room.
guylaw069	Can I sue Inspector Canard for false arrest?
guylaw070	I want to sue Ozzie Mandrill.  He's framed me for a crime I didn't commit.
guylaw071	I want to sue the twerp who's hurling boulders at my Mansion.
guylaw072	I'd like to sue the Ghost Pirate LeChuck for emotional distress.
guylaw073	Let's sue the electronic gaming industry for driving hardware requirements to ridiculous heights, even for simple adventure games.
guylaw074	I have no idea why I just said that.
guylaw075	Never mind, I changed my mind.
guylaw076	Well, I'll let you guys get back to work.
guylaw077	Nah, they'd probably reject it.
guylua001	Great pitchers of grog!
guylua002	They've done something horrible to the SCUMM Bar!
guylua003	It's the kitchen.
guylua004	It goes outside.
guylua005	Pardon me.
guylua006	Do you know what they did to the SCUMM Bar?
guylua007	It's what this place used to be.
guylua008	Before they redecorated it.
guylua009	It was dark, dingy, smelled like grog gone bad...
guylua010	<Sigh> Yeah.  It was great.
guylua011	What's good to eat here?
guylua012	I'm sure I wouldn't.
guylua013	Good stuff?  I hope by that you don't mean the stuff that looks like it lived in the bilge of a ship last week.
guylua014	You aren't from around here, are you?
guylua015	Then this is the wrong place.  You should be down by the docks, working the ships, drinking grog...
guylua016	Thanks for your time.
guylua017	Excuse me.
guylua018	What do you mean, great get up?
guylua019	No!  I AM a real swashbuckler!  My wife is the Governor.  I'm a mighty pirate captain!
guylua020	What's good on the menu?
guylua021	Really?  That sushi stuff looks pretty gross, if you ask me.
guylua022	Did you know this place used to be a real pirate bar?
guylua023	Oh yeah.  They had real grog, real pirates, and real fights.
guylua024	<Sigh>  Never mind.
guylua025	Enjoy your stay.
guylua026	Umm, miss?
guylua027	What happened to the SCUMM Bar?
guylua028	I'm a mighty thirsty pirate.
guylua029	Can you recommend something from the menu?
guylua030	Umm, what's sushi?
guylua031	That sounds pretty gross.
guylua032	Can I order some food?
guylua033	No thanks.  I'm fine.
guylua034	I'll have a grog.
guylua035	A grog, please.
guylua036	I could sure go for a nice grog.
guylua037	What?!  No grog?
guylua038	Perhaps I'll think it over.
guylua039	What kind of umbrella drinks?
guylua040	Thanks.
guylua041	What kind of bar doesn't serve grog?
guylua042	But that's all they used to serve here!
guylua043	But I really wanted a grog!
guylua044	But I liked the pirates.
guylua045	But I liked the swill.
guylua046	But I liked the wenches.
guylua047	I mean they, um, made it so authentically piratey.
guylua048	Never mind.  I kinda like it.
guylua049	Can you recommend something?
guylua050	I'll have that.
guylua051	Do you have anything that's cooked?
guylua052	What's the special?
guylua053	Uh, never mind.  I'm not all that hungry.
guylua054	Uh oh... I better move before he sees what I did.
guylua055	Nice grass skirt.
guylua056	Excuse me, miss?
guylua057	This guy doesn't look like he's from around these parts.
guylua058	She looks like she's enjoying her umbrella drinks just a little too much.
guylua059	Hmm... the style of this painting...
guylua060	It seems very...  Meathooky.
guylua061	That's an incredibly foofy-looking beverage.
guylua062	Nah.  REAL pirates don't drink anything that pretty!
guylua063	Those are some bizarre looking drinks.
guylua064	No thanks.  Give me a Grog over this stuff any day.
guylua065	There appears to be a minuscule meal set on this silly square-shaped tray.
guylua066	That wouldn't feed a squirrel.  What's the point?!
guylua067	Awww, how cute!  Little itty bitty boats floating around carrying itty bitty pieces of something that appears to be edible!
guylua068	There's some sort of mechanical stuff under the water that's making these boats go.
guylua069	No, those chains and metal stuff look pretty sharp.  I better try jamming it with something else.
guylua070	Darn... the chopsticks were too weak.  They just snapped right in half!
guylua071	These bar stools have flowers on them...
guylua072	Somehow that just doesn't seem right.
guylua073	This seat is all wet!  I better choose another one.
guylua074	I'll just sit over here.
guylua075	Mmm!  Roast pig!
guylua076	Hey, wait a minute... this little tag says it's pork sashimi.
guylua077	This pig isn't cooked!  Eugh!
guylua078	I gave up raw pig a long time ago.
guylua079	Sheesh!  Grumpy!
guylua080	That's a good idea but it doesn't look sturdy enough to jam the mechanism, and I'd hate for it to break.
guylua081	I don't think that'll fit in there.
guyluc001	Thanks, Mister Cheese.  Uh, next time, do you think we can get here with a little less drama?
guyluc002	Okay.  I'm goin' in to town.  You guys stay here and watch the ship.
guyluc003	Time to make sail, shipmates!
guyluc004	I was just looking for evidence.
guyluc005	Ah, Lucre Town.  The largest urban center in the Tri-Island Area.
guyluc006	That's a very aesthetically pleasing fountain.
guyluc007	I think.
guyluc008	I'm no dog!
guyluc009	I will not drink NOR frolic in this here fountain!
guyluc010	Wow, Lucre Town has a sewage system!
guyluc011	How nice is THAT!
guyluc012	Sorry, uh, must have been a trick of the light.
guyluc013	Sorry, must have been a passing cloud.
guyluc014	Oops, it was just a weather balloon.
guyluc015	Wow... what a very deep, dark hole...
guyluc016	Not to mention smelly... PHEW!
guyluc017	Um...
guyluc018	EEUUUUURRGGHHH!!!
guyluc019	It's just too heavy for me to pull open on my own.
guyluc020	Can I play next?
guyluc021	Oh.
guyluc022	Why so long?
guyluc023	Are you done yet?
guyluc024	So, who's winning?
guyluc025	Ah, I see.
guyluc026	Who's winning now?
guyluc027	I'm looking for a no-nosed pirate...
guyluc028	I don't think so.
guyluc029	Your friend seems awfully focused on the game.
guyluc030	Yes?
guyluc031	Interesting.
guyluc032	So, Castaneda really has a thing for the Bank Teller, huh?
guyluc033	I'll let you get back to your game.
guyluc034	Look, a three-headed monkey!
guyluc035	This perfume has a neat stripe running through it.
guyluc036	Yipes, there's a scorpion on your shoulder!
guyluc037	Look over there, it's something interesting!
guyluc038	Somebody's selling fish over here.
guyluc039	Holy macaroni, it's a time-travelling H.G. Wells, and he's drunk as a skunk!
guyluc040	Good gravy, is that a dagger I see before me!?
guyluc041	It's glued to the ground!
guyluc042	What a very large pier.
guyluc043	They sure got a lotta ships and boats parked here.
guyluc044	Phew.  This stand is excessively odoriferous.
guyluc045	Be glad this game doesn't have support for smell generation...
guyluc046	Hi, Brittany!
guyluc047	Oh look, it's Brittany!
guyluc048	Brittany, look out!
guyluc049	Brittany!
guyluc050	Oops, my mistake.  It was just another two-headed monkey.
guyluc051	Uh sorry, I was just having a grog flashback.
guyluc052	No, wait, it's just a duck.
guyluc053	Oh, no, it's just a box of yams.
guyluc054	Oh, darn... must've been the Aurora Borealis.
guyluc055	Nope.  Sorry.  Just a stick.
guyluc056	Um...
guyluc057	So...
guyluc058	Ahhh... It's nice to be able to sit down and rest my feet for a while.
guyluc059	Ya know, sitting here gets a guy to thinkin'...
guyluc060	Can I play next?
guyluc061	Oh.
guyluc062	Why?
guyluc063	Can I play now?
guyluc064	So, who's winning?
guyluc065	Ah, yes, of course.
guyluc066	Who's winning now?
guyluc067	I'm looking for a no-nosed pirate...
guyluc068	Uh, I don't know.
guyluc069	I'll let you get back to your game.
guyluc070	Hey there, Money Bags!
guyluc071	Hey!  I'm innocent!
guyluc072	It was the no-nosed man!
guyluc073	Eh, enough about me, how's the banking business?
guyluc074	Have you seen someone go by here carrying a bag of loot?
guyluc075	Sorta like me.
guyluc076	Really?!  Where?
guyluc077	When are you gonna reopen the bank?
guyluc078	I hear my parole officer calling.  See ya later.
guyluc079	I'll find the guy who did it, and wreak vengeance upon his soul!
guyluc080	Eh, you could have a bake sale.
guyluc081	You could steal enough to start your bank again.
guyluc082	Eh, at least you still have your health.
guyluc083	Good point.
guyluc084	Let me know how that works out for ya.
guyluc085	Why aren't you allowed inside?
guyluc086	Let's break in!
guyluc087	Then why are ya hanging around here?
guyluc088	You look kinda suspicious to me.
guyluc089	I don't know... most robberies are inside jobs.
guyluc090	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
guyluc091	What's with all the spritzing, mate?
guyluc092	Aren't you a little 'piratey' for a perfume salesman?
guyluc093	Uh huh.
guyluc094	You sure look like a pirate to me.
guyluc095	How do you stop being a pirate?
guyluc096	What's that?
guyluc097	Like selling scented bath water.
guyluc098	Why would you wanna quit being a pirate in the first place?
guyluc099	Um, yeah.
guyluc100	Doesn't Hugo miss being a pirate?
guyluc101	Eep.
guyluc102	You wouldn't happen to have seen a no-nosed pirate run by here with a sack a loot, would ya?
guyluc103	Eh, when I ran by with a sack a loot, which way was I going?
guyluc104	Thanks.
guyluc105	What's that ungodly stench you've been exposing to unsuspecting passers-by?
guyluc106	Who'd want to smell like LeChuck?
guyluc107	But LeChuck smelled like a rotting corpse!
guyluc108	Eau de LeChuck's really that popular?
guyluc109	Smell ya later.
guyluc110	Hey, Carla.
guyluc111	Where's Otis?
guyluc112	Otis is in jail!
guyluc113	Why aren't you on shore leave?
guyluc114	Since you're stuck here, would you like me to get you something from town?
guyluc115	Have you seen a no-nosed pirate run by here?
guyluc116	Yes, but now I'm looking for a pirate with no nose.
guyluc117	What are you talking about?
guyluc118	So, what you're saying is that you haven't seen a no-nosed pirate?
guyluc119	Still no sign of a no-nosed pirate?
guyluc120	I'll take that as a no, then.
guyluc121	Carry on, Carla.
guyluc122	Well, there's a lovely prostheses shop on the east side of the town square.
guyluc123	Is that a trick question?
guyluc124	Are you sure you don't need any prosthetic parts?
guyluc125	I've found a lovely bait shop on the outskirts of Lucre Town.
guyluc126	You want a handcrafted walking stick?  There's a shop that makes 'em.
guyluc127	I own five!
guyluc128	There's a nice perfume cart in the center of town.
guyluc129	No way, baby.  You've got the unmistakable funk of loooove.
guyluc130	Are you sure you don't want just a small bottle of perfume?
guyluc131	Okay, okay.  No perfume.
guyluc132	Actually, I have no idea.  I haven't taken a good look around yet.
guyluc133	Hmm, maybe I should do some more window shopping first.
guyluc134	Oh, Carla...
guyluc135	Carla!
guyluc136	What do you think you're doing?
guyluc137	Why are you getting drunk?
guyluc138	Forget what?
guyluc139	Are you trying to forget Monkey Island™?
guyluc140	Sorry.
guyluc141	Drinking isn't the answer, Carla.
guyluc142	Want to help me find the pieces of the Ultimate Insult?
guyluc143	Um--
guyluc144	How do you like this place?
guyluc145	Well, if this place is so awful, why don't you leave?
guyluc146	Why?
guyluc147	I'll let you go back to your, uh, shore leave.
guyluc148	It looks like you're trying to drink yourself into oblivion on crappy micro-grog.
guyluc149	It looks like you've been sampling the wares of this fine establishment.
guyluc150	Looks like you're looking for Mister Right, baby.
guyluc151	--gulp--
guyluc152	Is this a trick question?
guyluc153	Hey, it's a plate of BROWNIES!
guyluc154	Whoa, isn't that Bobby Fisher?
guyluc155	Yipes, there's a spider on your shoulder!
guyluc156	Wow, look at all those candy bars!
guyluc157	Ye gods, a phalanx of cross-dressing trilobites!
guyluc158	Holy macaroni, it's a time-travelling H.G. Wells, and he's brought a bucket of macaroni!
guyluc159	Good gravy, is that a tub full of gravy!?
guyluc160	Shh.  Don't move.  The Rapture is going on right behind you.
guyluc161	Omigosh, someone's set the food court on fire!
guyluc162	Look, up in the sky!
guyluc163	Aiiie...a giant lizard!
guyluc164	I wonder if I can get into the Bank through here...
guyluc165	I'll bet you could get into any bathroom on Lucre Island™ through here!
guyluc166	Hey!  It's like a trampoline!
guyluc167	Oh, wait, it was just a skinny cow.
guyluc168	Ooops, my bad... just an oil slick.
guyluc169	On second thought, I don't think I wanna go down there for any reason.
guyluc170	So...
guyluc171	Excuse me...
guyluc172	Oh crud!  I dropped the sword into the sewers.
guyluc173	Ah well, now it's a broken and very stinky sword.
guyluc174	WhoOOOaaa!
guyluc175	YEEEAAARGGGHHH! UGH!
guyluc176	.... ow ....
guyluc177	Rats, it's still pink.
guyluc178	We can't leave.  We're not done here yet.
guyluc179	This is a very pink and very feminine looking perfume.
guyluc180	Heck no!  I'm a tough pirate man!
guyluc181	It does smell nice though...
guyluc182	That's a nice blue hue.
guyluc183	Eh, no thanks.
guyluc184	Wow, what a plethora of colors in this bottle.
guyluc185	.... ick.
guyluc186	I don't think so.  That one scares me.
guyluc187	Hey, isn't that Bobby Fisher!?
guyluc188	Um.  No.  Looks too exotic to me.
guyluc189	There's absolutely nothing up here.
guyluc190	The salesperson isn't anywhere to be seen.
guyluc191	Hey!  Look!  A lucky penny!
guyluc192	Omigosh, someone's set the bar on fire!
guyluc193	Look, up in the sky!
guyluc194	Hey, isn't that Brittany, the Bank Teller?
guyluc195	I should talk to the salesman.
guyluc196	I better keep clear of this before I get accused of another crime I didn't commit.
guyluc197	I better get away from this place before I end up accused of a crime I didn't commit.
guyluc198	Triangulation of crossfire.  That's the key.
guyluc199	This bank sure has a lot of windows.
guyluc200	If only I could get up to that window.  Inspector Canard can't see me over here.
guyluc201	I can't reach that window standing down here on the ground.
guyluc202	I thought that laundry got hung up AFTER it was cleaned.
guyluc203	That laundry is not my size.
guyluc204	It's a quaint little park.
guyluc205	I.. uhh.. WOULD go back there, but... uhh.. I really don't WANT to... yeah.
guyluc206	Ah, there's nothing like the smell of buckets upon buckets of rotting fish in the morning sun.
guyluc207	Excuse me...
guyluc208	HEY!
guyluc209	Life is like pillaging a trading vessel bound for Jamestown...
guyluc210	Ya never know what you're gunna get.
guyluc211	Well, that's enough rest for me!
guyluc212	That bench looks mighty comfy.
guyluc213	Hey! Check out that pair of floatation devices.
guyluc214	No, Elaine probably wouldn't like that.
guyluc215	I think blue is a much better color for a ship.
guyluc216	Hmm.. maybe the owner of this boat wouldn't notice if I switched it with the Dainty Lady.
guyluc217	Lucre Island™ Port Authority
guyluc218	I better not go in there or they might get on my case about the damage my navigator did to the docks.
guyluc219	Some guys with funny accents from, 'up nord', came in on this boat.
guyluc220	Eh, I don't think I want to perturb the 'nord men' that own this.
guyluc221	This must be the 'ship shock shop' I heard Mister Cheese talking about.
guyluc222	Nah, I'll let my crew take care of finding replacement parts.
guyluc223	I have nothing witty to say about this house.
guyluc224	I can't go in there.
guyluc225	Whoever lives here must be pretty small.
guyluc226	I can't fit through that little door.
guyluc227	I can see Otis in there!
guyluc228	I don't think it'd be a good idea to try to bust Otis out.
guyluc229	It's a pile of empty perfume spritzer bottles.
guyluc230	I'll just take one.
guyluc231	I've already got one, I don't need another.
guyluc232	He doesn't look like he's concentrating too hard.
guyluc233	He looks a little miffed.
guyluc234	It's hard to take an angry fat man seriously.
guyluc235	Ahh, I don't think I should get in the middle of that.
guyluc236	He appears to be in deep concentration.
guyluc237	These are the lamest insults I've ever heard.
guyluc238	Smart pirates know not to get involved in domestic disputes.
guyluc239	It's I. Cheese, our wouldbe navigator.
guyluc240	It's Carla.  She looks bored.
guyluc241	It's the local law enforcement.
guyluc242	I think he's still pretty cheesed off about the bank robbery.
guyluc243	It's the path out of town.
guyluc244	I better visit the lawyers before I start exploring the island.
guyluc245	It's the door to the 'House o' Sticks'.
guyluc246	There'll be plenty of time for that AFTER I go to the law offices.
guyluc247	Ye Olde Bait Shoppe.
guyluc248	I should go the law offices before I get some bait.
guyluc249	The Lucre Bank.  Best place to put your loot.
guyluc250	I should go to the law offices before I get information on investment strategies.
guyluc251	It's the law offices.
guyluc252	'Palace o' Prostheses'.
guyluc253	I really should go to the law offices first.
guyluc254	It's the hall o' justice.
guyluc255	I should go the law offices before I go in there.
guyluc256	Ehh, that's the end of the pier right here.
guyluc257	I'm pretty sure there's nothing back there.
guyluc258	Ahoy there, Mister Cheese.
guyluc259	Good work getting us into the harbor.
guyluc260	Where can I find Otis?
guyluc261	How's the ship?  Uh, when will she be ready for departure?
guyluc262	Oh yeah, heh, that.
guyluc263	Well, um, okay then.  Keep the ship, er, ship-shape while I'm gone.
guyluc264	It's just a simple misunderstanding.
guyluc265	When I find the real criminal, my name shall no longer be mud.
guyluc266	Tha's not an anklet, it's a sacred voodoo talisman.
guyluc267	I'll be free in two shakes of the monkey's tail.
guyluc268	Actually, I don't like to talk about it.
guyluc269	What's wrong with the rudder?
guyluc270	What's wrong with the mast?
guyluc271	What's wrong with the deck?
guyluc272	Well, I'll leave it to you.
guyluc273	Bu... Hey!  Stop that!
guyluc274	Done paying your debt to society, Otis?
guyluc275	I don't think that'll open the manhole.
guyluc276	I don't think I should start bouncing my inventory all over the place.
guyluc277	I'd rather not throw my inventory into the sewers of Lucre Island™.
guyluc278	Why on Earth would I want to put the cover back on the manhole after I nearly gave myself a hernia removing it?!
guyluc279	There's a duckling on this.  Must be the duck standard.
guyluc280	I'll let the ducks carry their own flag.
guyluc281	Nice hatchet.
guyluc282	I don't want to make barrels.
guyluc283	What do you think of this?
guyluc284	It smells awful.
guyluc285	Does this remind you of anything?
guyluc286	I'd better not... I'd hate for him to think I stole something ELSE from the bank.
guyluc287	I don't think I should taunt the bank employees with booty they think I've stolen.
guyluc288	I'd better not... I'd hate for her to think I stole something ELSE from the bank.
guylum001	That's Ozzie Mandrill's house.
guylum002	Lucre Town.
guylum003	It's the lagoon that I followed Ozzie to!
guylum004	That's one creepy looking mansion.
guylum005	I think every self-respecting pirate island should have a spooky-looking swamp.
guymdo001	No, I'd better not.
guymdo002	My time share on this ship is up and the next group to have it could be here at any moment.
guymdo003	That rowboat is nowhere near as big as MY rowboat!
guymdo004	I don't think a rowboat will get me where I need to go.
guymdo005	Yep, that's the beautiful town of Mêlée.
guymdo006	Umm, figurehead lady?
guymdo007	Still hanging around?
guymdo008	What horrible abomination of nature gave you the ability to talk?
guymdo009	You look kind of familiar.
guymdo010	Nooo, I don't think so.
guymdo011	AAAAGH!
guymdo012	Stop!  That's the scariest thing I've ever seen.
guymdo013	What's with the surly attitude?
guymdo014	Good point.
guymdo015	Wanna be my official ship?
guymdo016	Ever heard of a voodoo talisman called the Ultimate Insult?
guymdo017	I thought you said you never heard of the Ultimate Insult?
guymdo018	But you drew a picture of the Ultimate Insult for me.
guymdo019	You really don't know what the Ultimate Insult is, do you?
guymdo020	I'm looking for something blue.
guymdo021	But this is important.  I need something blue, like a bride would wear at her wedding.
guymdo022	Not for me... it would've been for my wife.
guymdo023	I have to go now.
guymdo024	Do you know where it is?
guymdo025	Do you know what it looks like?
guymdo026	I've heard it can emasculate the toughest of pirates.
guymdo027	Are you sure you've heard of it?
guymdo028	No, I guess I don't want to be an anchor.
guymdo029	Did you mean that in the literal sense, or the figurative?
guymdo030	I'd make a better captain.
guymdo031	Let's drop the anchor topic.
guymel001	It's Carla and Otis, from my original crew!
guymel002	I could swear that I've seen those pirates somewhere before.
guymel003	What?
guymel004	Y'know, I have no earthly idea.
guymel005	Y'know, I haven't the foggiest idea.
guymel006	Y'know, I have no idea.
guymel007	No monkeys in here.
guymel008	Nah, there's no grog in it.
guymel009	The SCUMM Bar...
guymel010	Haven for the rowdiest bunch of drunken scalawags you'll ever see.
guymel011	LUA Bar???  What's a LUA?
guymel012	I doubt it would be practical, or good for my back, to carry a bar around.
guymel013	I wonder where this goes.  Too bad it's locked.  Guess I'll never find out.
guymel014	Somehow I think the land owners would protest.
guymel015	You know, I've never even been in there.
guymel016	I don't even think I'm registered to vote!
guymel017	Whoa... it's 3 o'clock again!  What a coincidence!
guymel018	Wow.  That's one flexible mer-boy.
guymel019	I suppose it WOULD make a good lawn ornament, but it'd never fit in my pants.
guymel020	That's the way home.
guymel021	That's the path to Mêlée Island™.
guymel022	It's the original International House of Mojo, supplier of all things voodoo-oriented.
guymel023	I wonder who the Voodoo Lady hired to run the place after she relocated to Puerto Pollo.
guymel024	It's a door that goes... somewhere.
guymel025	Nothing.  Just wanted to say 'hi' while on my way to stopping the catapult.
guymel026	What was it I was supposed to be doing?
guymel027	Oh yeah, thanks.
guymel028	Uh, looking for a bathroom?
guymel029	Those sure are the docks.
guymel030	There's the docks.
guymel031	Ahoy again!
guymel032	Ahoy there, fellow seafaring wastrels!
guymel033	You two look awfully familiar.
guymel034	Are you sure we haven't met?
guymel035	Hey, how'd you know my name!?
guymel036	True, but I still think you guys look familiar.
guymel037	I could swear that I know you guys.
guymel038	So, what have you rapscallions been up to?
guymel039	I'd love to hear some more about the old Mêlée Island™ gang.
guymel040	I'm putting together a crew for a mission to Lucre Island™.  Wanna join?
guymel041	I'll take that as a 'no', then.
guymel042	Aw, c'mon, join my crew.  It'll be fun.
guymel043	Won't you join my crew, for old time's sake?
guymel044	Well, how about...
guymel045	I can't believe you guys won't rejoin my crew.
guymel046	So, are you looking forward to our voyage?
guymel047	Be seeing ya.
guymel048	...A BRAND NEW CAR!
guymel049	Sorry, I kinda got caught up in the moment.
guymel050	...treasure...boatloads of treasure.
guymel051	Oh, yeah, heh.
guymel052	...some lovely property off the coast of Booty Island™.
guymel053	...cushy government jobs!
guymel054	You know, the kind where you're paid three times the going private sector rate...
guymel055	...no one checks your work...
guymel056	...and it's impossible to be fired.
guymel057	I'll see what I can do.
guymel058	...my undying and unconditional gratitude, baby.
guymel059	Hey, I'm married!
guymel060	Sorry.
guymel061	...um, come to think of it, I can't think of a good reason for you to join my crew.
guymel062	Didn't we run into each other last summer on Phatt Island™?
guymel063	Aren't you the famous comedy team of Yongler and Muntz?
guymel064	You haven't?  But they're brilliant!
guymel065	They do this bit about how men leave the commode seat up, ha ha ha, and how women, heh, heh, love to shop for boots, and...
guymel066	He, he, a ha, ha, ha!
guymel067	Ha-ha-ha.
guymel068	Heh.
guymel069	Well, I guess you had to be there.
guymel070	Dudes!  Aren't you the founding members of Keelhaul, the world's loudest pirate speed metal band?
guymel071	Neither can Keelhaul.
guymel072	Didn't we share a cruise to Monkey Island™ once?
guymel073	Carla?
guymel074	You can't fool me.  You're Carla, the Swordmaster of Mêlée Island™!
guymel075	And you're...
guymel076	Otis!
guymel077	I KNEW you guys looked familiar!
guymel078	You were two-thirds of my original Monkey Island™ crew!
guymel079	No, how difficult is it to...
guymel080	...ESCAPE FROM MONKEY ISLAND™?
guymel081	Gee, I'm sorry.
guymel082	Maybe I'm confusing you with some other pair of pirates.
guymel083	How about you, Otis?  What have you been doing for the last few years?
guymel084	Petty thievery?
guymel085	What vivid imagery.  So, how DO you earn a living?
guymel086	Whatever happened to Captain Smirk, the Sword Trainer?
guymel087	Where's the third member of our old crew?
guymel088	Drinking?
guymel089	Painting?  But the guy's got no hands!
guymel090	What have you been doing with yourself, Carla?
guymel091	You're never gonna forgive me for that, are you?
guymel092	That sounds productive.
guymel093	Australian?
guymel094	Gee.
guymel095	How sad.
guymel096	I'm tired of re-hashing the old days.  Let's talk about the here and now.
guymel097	These stories are too depressing.  Let's talk about something else.
guymel098	I was just leaving.
guymel099	Pressing business to attend to.
guymel100	Um, nothing, honey.  Why?
guymel101	I was just using this handy device to acquire the stuff I need.
guymel102	You'd be surprised at all the great goodies you can get with this thing.
guymel103	Oh, but I need this stuff.
guymel104	Aww, you never let me have any fun.
guymel105	Elaine, not in front of everybody!
guymel106	It's not a toy.
guymel107	Aww, I hate when you get all Gubernatorial on me.
guymel108	Guess I won't be able to swing that command performance of 'The Monkey and I' after all.
guymel109	Elaine?!
guymel110	Oh, right.  I forgot to kiss you good-bye.
guymel111	Clean underwear?
guymel112	Thanks.  I almost forgot!
guymel113	I don't think so.  The ship is fully stocked with pork rinds, grog, and girly-books.
guymel114	Oooh, yeah.  Here.
guymel115	Um, honey?
guymel116	Elaine, darling?
guymel117	Shnookums?
guymel118	What should I be doing now?
guymel119	Ohhh, yeah.
guymel120	What do you think the Ultimate Insult is?
guymel121	Probably.
guymel122	I talked to the Voodoo Lady about the Ultimate Insult!
guymel123	She said it was an ancient voodoo talisman capable of permanently shattering the souls of pirates!
guymel124	Wanna hear any more about the Ultimate Insult?
guymel125	Um, not yet, no.
guymel126	The Voodoo Lady found Grandpa Marley's wedding gifts.
guymel127	Hmm.  Maybe these gifts really DO hold the secret of the Ultimate Insult.
guymel128	They clearly weren't intended to be proper wedding gifts.
guymel129	Do you wanna take another look at your grandfather's wedding gifts?
guymel130	It's times like this I wish I wasn't an insensitive macho pirate.
guymel131	How goes the campaign?  Can I help?
guymel132	Can I have some money NOW?
guymel133	I could've really used some cash on Lucre Island™.
guymel134	I dunno...to buy stuff, I guess.
guymel135	Rats.
guymel136	I really think that my search for the Ultimate Insult would be helped by large piles of cash.
guymel137	Well, I'm off to find the Ultimate Insult.
guymel138	They've already agreed to be on my crew.
guymel139	I don't think they'd want an empty bowl.
guymel140	Excuse me?
guymel141	Would either of you like a kudu jerky pretzel?
guymel142	She looks awfully busy.
guymel143	It's 3 o'clock.
guymel144	I'm confused.
guymel145	How can LeChuck be alive?
guymel146	Relatively speaking, of course.
guymel147	What IS the Ultimate Insult, and why are LeChuck and Ozzie Mandrill after it?
guymel148	What do your grandfather's heirlooms have to do with all of this?
guymel149	Well, I've got a plan!
guymel150	Let's hide in the mansion until this whole thing blows over.
guymel151	But it's so unheroic, it just might work.
guymel152	Why don't I run for governor, while you try to figure out the mysteries of the Ultimate Insult.
guymel153	Let's work together to find out the Secret of Big Whoop.
guymel154	Oops.  Sorry, wrong script.
guymel155	Umm, okay.  How?
guymel156	But--
guymel157	So this is what it's like being a first lady.
guymel158	'Ye Olde Creepy, Unlit Place for Books.'
guymel159	Gee, that doesn't sound too inviting.
guymel160	'Sold.'
guymel161	'Sold'...I'm detecting a pattern here.
guymel162	Another 'Sold' sign.
guymel163	You told me to return the Gubernatorial Symbol when I got back from Lucre Island™, remember?
guymem001	Artists live in the strangest places.
guymem002	That's where Meathook used to live.
guymem003	That's the town of Mêlée.
guymem004	Ah, nature's boat storage.
guymhe001	Knock knock.
guymhe002	'Meathook's House of Wax.'
guymhe003	Hmm... it says 'Wax Show'.  I wonder if they're showing 'Mad Wax: Beehive Warrior'.
guymhe004	Hey look!  A full moon!
guymhe005	Arooooooooooooooo!
guymhe006	Pick up the moon?  Are you nuts?
guymhe007	Looks like Meathook finally got himself a bridge.
guymhe008	Personally, I kinda miss the old pulley-n-poultry method.
guymhe009	I can see the forests of Mêlée Island™ from here.
guymhe010	It's Meathook's place.
guymhe011	It's locked.
guymhe012	It's me again.
guymhi001	Anybody home?
guymhi002	Then who're you?
guymhi003	When do you expect someone to be home?
guymhi004	But there's supposed to be a wax show today.
guymhi005	Yes there is.
guymhi006	The sign out here says there is.
guymhi007	It's okay.  It's me.
guymhi008	Oh.  Okay.  Bye.
guymhi009	Okay.  I'll come back later.
guymhi010	I'm the plumber, I've come to fix the sink.
guymhi011	Real estate.
guymhi012	Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate.
guymhi013	Eh, nobody.
guymhi014	What are you talking about?
guymhi015	Meathook!
guymhi016	Hi there, Meathook ol' pal.
guymhi017	I thought we could catch up on old times.
guymhi018	I thought we could do some more catching up on old times.
guymhi019	What's with all the candles?
guymhi020	Your art?  I didn't know you had an art.
guymhi021	Nice.
guymhi022	So, how did you end up painting with wax?
guymhi023	Sorry.
guymhi024	Too late--
guymhi025	That's the silliest story I've heard in hours.
guymhi026	Do you sell a lot of these wax-dripping paintings?
guymhi027	Why?
guymhi028	The humor of the artistic elite has always escaped me.
guymhi029	I'm looking for something called the 'Ultimate Insult,' and I could use your help.
guymhi030	I could still use your help looking for this 'Ultimate Insult' dingus.
guymhi031	Nothing important.  Go back to what you were doing.
guymhi032	How did you and Carla and Otis ESCAPE FROM MONKEY ISLAND™?
guymhi033	On Herman's hidden pirate ship?
guymhi034	If you didn't use Herman's ship, how DID you ESCAPE FROM MONKEY ISLAND™?
guymhi035	Aw, c'mon.
guymhi036	Whatever happened to your parrot?
guymhi037	Hunger?
guymhi038	Do you still do that thing you do?
guymhi039	You know, that funny thing you do!
guymhi040	C'mon, do the funny thing you do!
guymhi041	You know, that thing you do with the talking and the face.
guymhi042	If you don't want to do the funny thing, just say so.
guymhi043	You know, the thing with the...tattoo.
guymhi044	That's it!
guymhi045	Could you do that thing with the tattoo again?
guymhi046	On second thought, I really don't have time to reminisce.
guymhi047	Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.
guymhi048	What?
guymhi049	There's not a clam alive or dead that can defeat Guybrush Threepwood!
guymhi050	Although you'd be surprised how many have tried.
guymhi051	I can't be killed, I've got an unbreakable five-game contract!
guymhi052	Maybe you should try branching out into new genres.
guymhi053	Hmm, that's too bad.
guymhi054	Do you have any idea what the Ultimate Insult is?
guymhi055	Do you know what the Ultimate Insult looks like?
guymhi056	I'm looking for Grandpa Marley's fourth wedding present.
guymhi057	Because it will help me find the island of the pieces of the Ultimate Insult.
guymhi058	Where's that painting today?
guymhi059	Do you still have it?
guymhi060	Darn.
guymhi061	Do you think that the map you painted for Grandpa Marley is really the fourth wedding present?
guymhi062	And you really don't know where it is?
guymhi063	I found the map you painted for Grandpa Marley!
guymhi064	Trust me, you don't want to know.
guymhi065	Do you have any idea what I'm supposed to do with this map?
guymhi066	I think I'll plumb this Ultimate Insult mystery on my own.
guymhi067	Meathook - Once a nasty pirate, now a salty ol' wax painter.
guymhi068	I don't think he would like that very much
guymhi069	Wow, this stone guy sure has some hot breath.
guymhi070	I know I'm totally ripped, but I don't think I could carry several tons of masonry with me.
guymhi071	Hmmm... wouldn't the molten wax slide down the face of the canvas if it were on the easel?
guymhi072	It's a barrel full of rolled up paper...
guymhi073	a bad-dog's worst nightmare.
guymhi074	What vibrant colors...
guymhi075	No, I prefer watercolors.  And finger-painting.
guymhi076	It reminds me of dolphin-free-tuna advertisements.
guymhi077	I don't think this would match the decor in our living room.
guymhi078	Aaaahhhh... a Caribbean sunrise.
guymhi079	Wait a minute... I don't think I've ever actually SEEN one of those in real life...
guymhi080	Ah, the Thirsty Buccaneer Mountains, where we get expensive bottled Aye-Vion mountain spring water!
guymhi081	Hmm... this could be any one of a million places on these islands
guymhi082	It could be in my own backyard for all I know...
guymhi083	...
guymhi084	Oh.  Okay.
guymhi085	I wonder if he recycles these candles in his art.
guymhi086	OW!  That's HOT!
guymhi087	More fun than a barrel full of... uh... wax?
guymhi088	He sure does have a lot of barrels full of stuff in here.
guymhi089	I don't even need ONE barrel, much less MULTIPLE barrels.
guymhi090	A box full of grenade canisters!
guymhi091	Oh...... I knew that.
guymhi092	That goes outside.
guymhi093	I don't think Meathook would like it if I got wax all over his precious paint brush.
guymib001	Timmy want a banana?
guymib002	I guess so.
guymib003	I don't think Timmy likes to be picked up.  I'll have to think of a better way to get him to follow me.
guymib004	It looks like that's the only bunch of bananas in the area that these ravenous monkeys haven't gotten their opposable thumbs on yet...
guymib005	I can't reach it from down here.
guymib006	Got one!
guymib007	OOOoof!
guymib008	Ah, the sea.  Giver of life.  Destroyer of ships.  Home of fish.
guymib009	I really don't think I'm in good enough shape to SWIM back to Mêlée Island™.
guymib010	This poor starfish died on the dry sandy shore of Monkey Island™.  I hope I don't share his fate.
guymib011	It's not wise to disturb the dead.
guymib012	Wow, I'm glad I didn't accidentally squish Timmy.
guymib013	That path leads into the mysterious depths of Monkey Island™.
guymig001	He appears to be the bartender.
guymig002	That doesn't look so menacing.
guymig003	I draw the line at putting MECHANICAL manatees in my pants.
guymig004	Ready!
guymig005	Woo... Whoa!  Whoooa!  Hooawa!  Oof!  ... ow...
guymig006	Bring it on!!
guymig007	Yaaaaaa-hoooo!
guymig008	Yeeeeaaaaagh!
guymig009	Aaaugh... Is it over yet?
guymig010	Is...
guymig011	it...
guymig012	over...
guymig013	yet?!
guymig014	AAAaaaahhhhh..
guymig015	I'll just splatter some glue on here like this...
guymig016	Voila!  A puddle o' glue!
guymig017	This bar counter is incredibly clean and un-sticky.
guymig018	I haven't even had any drinks, I'm certainly not picking up anybody else's bar tabs!
guymig019	This must be where grog comes from.
guymig020	Ummm, better not.  Elaine wouldn't appreciate the smell if I started brewing grog at home.
guymig021	It goes outside to town.
guymig022	Hi.
guymig023	I'd like a drink please.
guymig024	Noooo...
guymig025	Well, what's the point of that?!
guymig026	Grog Jr.™ is the most foul tasting beverage I've EVER tasted...
guymig027	... may I please have another?
guymig028	So how's business?
guymig029	What about just plain, old fashioned grog grog?
guymig030	Tell me again about the greatness of your Micro-Groggery.
guymig031	So what is that thing over there with a saddle on it?
guymig032	So what's the deal with that Manatee thing again?
guymig033	Why does this island seem so... wholesome?
guymig034	Family compliant?!
guymig035	Role models?!
guymig036	Oh, er, no, no!  I try to plant a tree... and give insult swordfigh... err... grammar lessons to children every day!
guymig037	Have a nice day there.
guymig038	What the heck is a manatee?
guymig039	That doesn't sound menacing at all!
guymig040	Sounds more like a swimming cow.
guymig041	What is this mechanical manatee here for?
guymig042	Why is that Manatee thing here again?
guymig043	I'd like to take a crack at riding that Manatee thing.
guymig044	I want another shot at taming the manatee.
guymig045	Uh, this manatee talk is too strange for me.  Let's talk about something else.
guymig046	Never mind.
guymig047	Oh my.  Carla looks pretty sloshed.
guymig048	There's no way I'm getting back on that thing!
guymig049	Hey barkeep!  Make the manatee go!
guymig050	I'd better ask the bartender before touching this...  whatever it is.
guymig051	I think she's had just about enough grog for this adventure...and the next three or four adventures.
guymig052	It's gonna take something a lot more powerful than THIS to sober her up.
guymig053	I sure showed it who's boss!
guymig054	Now that saddle's as sticky as the floor of the SCUMM Bar!
guymob001	Oh, uhh.  Where am I...?
guymob002	<Sniff, sniff>  This island smells kind of familiar.
guymob003	Ugh, only one island smells as bad as...
guymob004	...oh no!
guymob005	Those two maladjusted greed-monsters left me marooned on...
guymob006	...Monkey Island™.
guymob007	Well, that's it.  I give up.
guymob008	I'll never overcome these incessant obstacles.
guymob009	It's like my whole life is a never-ending series of... ...of puzzles.
guymob010	Oh, hey Timmy.
guymob011	Don't try to cheer me up.  Just give up.
guymob012	I know I am.
guymob013	Oh all right...I'll do it for the kids.
guymob014	First order of business: Get off this stupid island!
guymob015	Second order of business:  Stop Ozzie and LeChuck from using the Ultimate Insult on Elaine and assorted others!
guymob016	Third order of business:  Buy some new shoes!
guymob017	How'd he get here, anyway?
guymob018	'To all you monkeys running loose on the island.'
guymob019	Please refrain from stealing my banana stash.  THEY'RE MINE!'
guymob020	Signed, H.T.
guymob021	'H.T. -- RE: Mining operations.'
guymob022	'Stop them.  At once.  Your mining is causing sink-holes in our sacred island.'
guymob023	Signed, JJJ.
guymob024	'To all LeChuck-fearing citizens of Monkey Island™.'
guymob025	'You are cordially invited to play bingo at the church every Tuesday at midnight.'
guymob026	'Non-members welcome.'
guymob027	Signed, Father Rasputin, CoL, Orthodox.
guymob028	I wonder if that would be Tuesday morning, or Tuesday night?
guymob029	'Ever-increasing monkey population:'
guymob030	'Stop over-populating the island.  There are only so many bananas.'
guymob031	'Which reminds me:  Leave my banana stash alone!'
guymob032	Signed H.T.
guymoh001	That's the second biggest monkey head I've ever seen.
guymoh002	It looks heavy for its size.
guymoh003	Oh, when monkey eyes are smiling... and... it, eh.  No wait, that's not right.
guymoh004	That's where the control room is.
guymoh005	Hasn't been cleaned in a while.
guymoh006	There's some nasty wax buildup.
guymoh007	Hmm, there's also what appears to be part of a broken Q-tip.
guymoh008	Ohhh, yeaaah.
guymoh009	It's lodged in there too tight.
guymoh010	I can't imagine this thing smells good when it's open.
guymoh011	Monkey halitosis.
guymoh012	I can't believe I'm looking up the nose of a giant monkey.
guymoh013	It looks like there's some sort of latch in there.
guymoh014	It seems to have failed due to a stress fracture and too much torsional pressure.
guymoh015	I can't imagine why I'd need such a thing.... again.
guymoh016	'Here lies Jojo Sr., loyal to the end.'
guymoh017	Jojo's final resting spot.
guymoh018	I'm not gonna desecrate the grave of such a brave monkey.
guymoh019	It leads to the rest of the island.
guymoh020	I guess there's more than one way to skin a monkey...
guymoh021	Frightening.  A monkey head on a stick.
guymoh022	It goes into the Monkey Head.
guymoh023	You stay here.
guymoh024	Wow!  It's effectively a gigantic Ultimate Insult!
guymoh025	Now if I can somehow manage to stick this huuuge head onto a golden man, I'll have a giant Ultimate Insult!
guymoh026	I don't think that ear is detachable.
guymoh027	Now if I can find a bronze hat to put on top of this thing, I'll have a massive Ultimate Insult!
guymom001	It's Monkey Town.
guymom002	I think that's where those vegetarian cannibals used to live.
guymom003	It's a clearing with a giant monkey head.
guymom004	It looks like a pile of junk.
guymom005	It's Chez Toothrot.
guymom006	It's where Grandpa Marley lives.
guymom007	It's a beach.
guymom008	Nice canyon.
guymom009	Looks like there'd be a nice view from up there.
guymom010	It's the church of LeChuck.
guymom011	It's a strange and creepy castle built on the volcano.
guymon001	Ack
guymon002	Oop
guymon003	Eek
guymon004	Chee
guymon005	En garde, monkey!
guymon006	Let's rumble!
guymon007	Let's see what you got.
guymon008	Uh, never mind.
guymon009	Sorry I stopped ya.
guymon010	Go about your business.
guymon011	Rats.  I lost again.
guymon012	I don't think I have the hang of this yet.
guymon013	Hey!  I'm getting pretty good.
guymon014	I think I might be ready to take on Jojo Jr.
guymon015	Hello again, Monkey Prince.
guymon016	Hey hey hey hey!  You can talk!
guymon017	I still can't believe you're a talking monkey.
guymon018	Hey, neat hat!
guymon019	I can't stop admiring your hat.
guymon020	Can I have it?
guymon021	I want off this crazy island.
guymon022	That's very profound, but I have no idea what you just said.
guymon023	I want off this crazy island.  Can you help me or not?
guymon024	Great.  How am I supposed to get back to Mêlée without a ship?
guymon025	Any less nebulous clues about how to get off of Monkey Island™?
guymon026	No details?
guymon027	Since when are there so many monkeys on Monkey Island™?
guymon028	Great Summoning?  What are you talking about?
guymon029	Could you, uh, cut to the chase?  I... I got an important meeting to get to.
guymon030	Tell me again why all the monkeys are here?
guymon031	Tell me more about Monkey Kombat.
guymon032	I challenge you to Monkey Kombat!
guymon033	Eh, prophecies, shmophecies...are we gonna fight, or what?
guymon034	I challenge you to Monkey Kombat!  Again!
guymon035	Do you always have to do that?
guymon036	I really should be going.
guymon037	Uh, me too.
guymon038	Okay, so why not a talking monkey?
guymon039	How did this come to pass, oh great one?
guymon040	Short version, please?
guymon041	Your father?  You mean...?
guymon042	You mean you could talk!
guymon043	Do any other monkeys talk?
guymon044	What I really want to talk about is...
guymon045	Um, okay, but can I have your hat?
guymon046	What do you mean 'hat of honor'?
guymon047	Is it bronze?
guymon048	From here it looks bronze.
guymon049	I'm tired of discussing your hat.
guymon050	Something BIG?
guymon051	But how did they know to come here?
guymon052	I didn't.  I had no choice.
guymon053	Ozzie Mandrill and LeChuck brought them all here?
guymon054	How did all these monkeys get here?
guymon055	Are any of those paths reversible?
guymon056	I'd sure like to get off this island.
guymon057	Gee, thanks.
guymon058	Eh, never mind the monkeys for a minute.
guymon059	What exactly is Monkey Kombat?
guymon060	Well, how does it work?
guymon061	And the fourth?
guymon062	How do I Stall?
guymon063	How do I Deflect?
guymon064	How do I make a Comeback?
guymon065	If I beat you at Monkey Kombat, can I have your hat?
guymon066	Great!  Let the Kombat begin!
guymon067	This is giving me a headache.
guymon068	He has a bronze hat on.
guymon069	Jojo is certainly one refined monkey.
guymon070	This monkey appears to have some musical talent.
guymon071	If you can call that music.
guymon072	How cute.  He's banging his cymbals together over and over and over and over again.
guymon073	Strange.  This monkey seems more interested in his musical instrument than in bananas.
guymon074	I guess he's really intent on starting that monkey band.
guymon075	I wonder if the new inhabitants realize this hut was once owned by a human cannibal.
guymon076	Actually, I guess the monkeys don't really care.
guymon077	No, I've been spoiled by living in a mansion.  This just doesn't cut it anymore.
guymon078	Leftover cannibal art.
guymon079	I'm not in tune with my voodoo side.  I don't know what I'd do with it.
guymon080	Ew.  It smells poopy back there.
guymon081	Why does that sound familiar?
guymon082	Oh, no...
guymon083	Gee, that's, um, horrible.
guymon084	So all I have to do is learn which stances beat the others, right?
guymon085	I was afraid you'd say that.
guymon086	What are those battle stances again?
guymon087	Could you show me that Drunken Monkey-to-Anxious Ape move again?
guymon088	Could you teach me some of the other Monkey Kombat insults?
guymon089	But you already told me one of the insults!
guymon090	Are there any secret tips to mastering Monkey Kombat?
guymon091	Rats.
guymon092	I don't think it's that easy.
guymon093	Let him get his own coconut.
guymon094	Funny.  He doesn't seem interested in the accordion any more.
guymon095	It's the ladder to that hut.
guymon096	No, I think I'll leave the monkeys that live there alone.
guymon097	There doesn't seem to be anything interesting back there.
guymon098	Ha!  I won!
guymon099	There're buttons and levers 'n' stuff in the Giant Monkey Head!
guymon100	I think I need some monkeys.
guymon101	The gauges inside the Giant Monkey Head are telling me that I'm low on monkeys.
guymon102	I put the hat on the Giant Monkey Head, but the monkeys don't seem to care.
guymon103	Are there any other Monkey Kombat tips you wish to impart, my wise little monkey friend?
guymon104	How do I employ this 'Monkey See, Monkey Do' strategy?
guymot001	If you're really me in the future, then what number am I thinking of?
guymot002	Creepy.  That IS the number I'm thinking of!
guymot003	I guess you really are me.
guymot004	Twenty-eight and a half.
guymot005	Nine thousand, four hundred, fifty two.
guymot006	Twelve.
guymot007	Sixty-nine.
guymot008	Ninety-three.
guymot009	One-one-three-eight
guymot010	Thanks Guybrush!  You're the greatest!
guymot011	Here, take this.
guymot012	Oh, you'll need this, too
guymot013	...and this...
guymot014	Oh, I've got one more thing for you.
guymot015	Uhm, great. A rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle.
guymot016	Ooh, a rope.  That'll be useful.
guymot017	Hey, hey, great, a gun!  Watch out, Pegnose.
guymot018	Uh oh..
guymot019	Don't leave!  You'll cause a paradox or something!
guymot020	Oh, nuts...
guymot021	Aren't you forgetting to give me something?
guymot022	Oh, no.  I just tore apart the fabric of space-time, didn't I?
guymot023	Yup.
guymot024	Here, take this.
guymot025	Oh, you'll need this, too.
guymot026	...and this...
guymot027	Thanks Guybrush!  You're the greatest!
guymot028	Oh, I've got one more thing for you.
guymot029	Hmmmm...
guymot030	I'd better not...I think all this talking to my self is wreaking havoc with the space-time continuum.
guymot031	No!  Don't say anything!
guymot032	You'll cause a paradox!
guymot033	Ow!
guymot034	Gee, they're right...gun owners ARE five times more likely to shoot themselves...
guymot035	Something doesn't feel right here.
guymot036	No.  I'm sure I gave it to me for a reason.
guymot037	I better keep this for now, it might come in handy later.
guymot038	No, I'd prefer to hang on to this for a while.
guymot039	It's a crude raft.
guymot040	It's a gate.
guymot041	No way!  That's probably Pegnose Pete disguised as me again!
guymot042	I bet I could open any lock with this key!
guymot043	If only I had a key hole to use it with.
guymot044	I've never had a gun in any of my previous adventures...this should be fun.
guymot045	It's a fifty foot long piece of rope.
guymot046	Give or take a few feet.
guymot047	I COULD do some fancy rope tricks right now, but the animators would hate me.
guymot048	I haven't seen one of these in a long time.
guymot049	It seems heavier than I remember it, though.
guymot050	Alone, it's just as useless as it's always been.
guymot051	It's a stinky puddle of swamp water.
guymot052	Mighty pirates don't need to splash around in puddles.
guymot053	I've always wanted swamp scented perfume.
guymot054	It's the way out of the swamp.
guymot055	What's this for?
guymot056	Who are you?
guymot057	Where did you get this?
guymot058	That's not how it goes!  Don't you remember what you said when you were where I am now!?
guymot059	I'm you in the future!  I need you to open the gate for me.
guymot060	It's a skeleton key, the most useful item that you could ever possibly ask for in an adventure game.  Use it to open the gate.
guymot061	What do you think it's for?  Open the gate, dummy.
guymot062	I'm Guybrush Threepwood!  Now do yourself a favor and open the gate.
guymot063	Who do you think I am? Open the gate for yourself, okay?
guymot064	You'll see soon enough.  Could you be a sport and help yourself through the gate now?
guymot065	That's not important.  What's important is that you open the gate for me or you'll never solve this puzzle.
guymot066	Cripes, do I always sound this annoying?  Will you open the gate for yourself already?!
guymot067	Wrong!
guymot068	Hey Guybrush!  I need your help!
guymot069	Are you SURE that you want to give me that right now?
guymot070	Wait a second...
guymot071	That doesn't seem right.
guymot072	AAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!
guymot073	AAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!
guymot074	Woah.
guymot075	I hate it when that happens.
guymot076	I guess I did something wrong.
guymot077	I better not do THAT again.
guymot078	Why does that always happen?
guymot079	That was FUN!
guymot080	This is getting sickening.
guymot081	Boy, it sure would be nice if I'd figure this puzzle out already.
guymot082	Thanks, um, me.  I'll try to be careful.
guymot083	I can't reach the key hole from this side of the gate.
guymot084	I'll need someone to help me.
guymot085	I'd prefer to keep this gate between myself and the corpse.
guymot086	Gee, I feel like I'm hopelessly lost.
guymot087	I hope I can find my way out of this place.
guymot088	I think I need some sort of compass to navigate these marshes.
guymot089	I feel like I'm going in circles.
guymot090	These swamps are confusing the bejeebers out of me.
guymot091	There's no way I'll ever find my way through here without a map or something.
guymot092	I don't think I'm making any progress here.
guymot093	If you're really me, then what number am I thinking of right now?
guymrb001	That's how I got in here.
guymrb002	The hatch is closed.
guymrb003	These controls seem too small for a human.
guymrb004	They must be part of the monkey head machine.
guymrb005	I wonder what they're for.
guymrb006	I prefer to read the instruction manual before playing with complicated machinery.
guymrb007	I wonder what this valve controls.
guymrb008	Curious as I am, I think I'll leave it alone for safety's sake.
guymrb009	I could be scalded by steam, or something.
guymrb010	I wonder what this gauge is for.
guymrb011	I'm not sure how I'd do that.
guymrb012	These must be the inner workings of the monkey-head machine.
guymrb013	What in the Sir Francis Drake does all this machinery do?
guymrb014	I have no idea how.
guyoze001	That fountain gives me the heebie-jeebies.
guyoze002	No, thanks.
guyoze003	That watch-bird gives me the heebie-jeebies.
guyoze004	It wouldn't go with the decor of the Governor's Mansion.
guyoze005	All of Ozzie's guests must be very short.
guyoze006	It's a house!
guyoze007	It's locked.
guyoze008	It's the door to Ozzie's house.
guyoze009	It's the front door of this fabulous (though creepy) mansion.
guyoze010	It leads back to the Lucre Island™ forests.
guyoze011	Maybe the person that lives in this.. this abode, will be home later.
guyoze012	That's a very small door.
guyoze013	I'm not getting any closer to that fountain than I have to.  It might bite my hand off.
guyozi001	There's something creepy about that guy.
guyozi002	Grandpa Marley's letter mentioned the Ultimate Insult.
guyozi003	Wonder if it's important.
guyozi004	Hmm.  Once I clear my name, I really should find out what this Ultimate Insult thingy is.
guyozi005	It's a good thing he's so gullible.
guyozi006	Sheesh.  What a grouch.
guyozi007	Agreed.
guyozi008	So, what form of Insult Game shall we play?
guyozi009	Oh, that is so cliché!
guyozi010	I... lost.
guyozi011	I can't believe I lost again.
guyozi012	I don't know why I keep losing.
guyozi013	Now it smells like mountain breezes.
guyozi014	Now its smell is eerily evocative of winter meadows.
guyozi015	The stench has been replaced by faint traces of autumn pastures.
guyozi016	Now all I can smell is the elusive scent of spring showers.
guyozi017	Instead, this smells more like subtle sea zephyrs.
guyozi018	It smells awful!
guyozi019	It doesn't smell like Eau de LeChuck anymore.
guyozi020	Poor thing.
guyozi021	Poor, ferocious, man-eating, giant crocodile.
guyozi022	Poor, ferocious, man-eating, giant platypus.
guyozi023	Poor, ferocious, man-eating, giant wombat.
guyozi024	Poor, ferocious, man-eating, giant koala.
guyozi025	Poor, ferocious, man-eating, giant dingo.
guyozi026	Poor, ferocious, man-eating, giant kangaroo.
guyozi027	Poor, ferocious, man-eating, giant ostrich.
guyozi028	Poor, defenseless, giant crocodile.
guyozi029	Poor, defenseless, giant platypus.
guyozi030	Poor, defenseless, giant wombat.
guyozi031	Poor, defenseless, giant koala.
guyozi032	Poor, defenseless, giant dingo.
guyozi033	Poor, defenseless, giant kangaroo.
guyozi034	Poor, defenseless, giant ostrich.
guyozi035	Poor, endangered, giant crocodile.
guyozi036	Poor, endangered, giant platypus.
guyozi037	Poor, endangered, giant wombat.
guyozi038	Poor, endangered, giant koala.
guyozi039	Poor, endangered, giant dingo.
guyozi040	Poor, endangered, giant kangaroo.
guyozi041	Poor, endangered, giant ostrich.
guyozi042	Poor, dim-witted, giant crocodile.
guyozi043	Poor, dim-witted, giant platypus.
guyozi044	Poor, dim-witted, giant wombat.
guyozi045	Poor, dim-witted, giant koala.
guyozi046	Poor, dim-witted, giant dingo.
guyozi047	Poor, dim-witted, giant kangaroo.
guyozi048	Poor, dim-witted, giant ostrich.
guyozi049	Poor, cuddly-wuddly, giant crocodile.
guyozi050	Poor, cuddly-wuddly, giant platypus.
guyozi051	Poor, cuddly-wuddly, giant wombat.
guyozi052	Poor, cuddly-wuddly, giant koala.
guyozi053	Poor, cuddly-wuddly, giant dingo.
guyozi054	Poor, cuddly-wuddly, giant kangaroo.
guyozi055	Poor, cuddly-wuddly, giant ostrich.
guyozi056	Poor, doomed, hapless, giant crocodile.
guyozi057	Poor, doomed, hapless, giant platypus.
guyozi058	Poor, doomed, hapless, giant wombat.
guyozi059	Poor, doomed, hapless, giant koala.
guyozi060	Poor, doomed, hapless, giant dingo.
guyozi061	Poor, doomed, hapless, giant kangaroo.
guyozi062	Poor, doomed, hapless, giant ostrich.
guyozi063	It's not as much fun when Ozzie isn't here to enjoy the prank, too.
guyozi064	I thought he'd never leave.
guyozi065	It's too far away.
guyozi066	I'd hate to see the creature that laid this!
guyozi067	No, I have no interest in trying to hatch the egg.
guyozi068	Guns don't kill wild animals, Ozzie kills wild animals.
guyozi069	REAL pirates don't need guns!
guyozi070	I'll bet there's just more creepy stuffed relics behind this door.
guyozi071	It's locked.
guyozi072	It's the way out of this carnival of cadavers.
guyozi073	Ow, I think that hurt.
guyozi074	I have no idea what you just said, yet I feel strangely insulted.
guyozi075	I'm what what a what what?
guyozi076	I can't argue with that.
guyozi077	I'm sure that was a stinging insult, but I don't know why.
guyozi078	Well, didgeridoo to you, too!
guyozi079	What was that part in the middle about the thing?
guyozi080	What the heck are you saying!?
guyozi081	That's not an insult!  Is it?
guyozi082	Right back at ya!
guyozi083	Uhhhhhh...
guyozi084	Oh yeah!?
guyozi085	Every enemy I've met I've annihilated!
guyozi086	I've defeated twelve people today, alone!
guyozi087	This is the END for you, you gutter-crawling cur!
guyozi088	Would you like to be buried or cremated?
guyozi089	Give up now, or I will crush you like a grape!
guyozi090	Soon you'll be wearing my sword like a shish kebab!
guyozi091	You can't match my witty repartee.
guyozi092	You fight like a dairy farmer!
guyozi093	My sword is famous all over the Caribbean!
guyozi094	Killing you would be justifiable homicide.
guyozi095	Your mother was a hamster!
guyozi096	I usually see people like you passed-out on tavern floors.
guyozi097	I'm gunna put your arm in a sling!
guyozi098	You have the sex appeal of a Shar-Pei.
guyozi099	You have the manners of a beggar.
guyozi100	Hey, look over there!
guyozi101	I'll give you a choice.  You can be gutted, or decapitated!
guyozi102	I've spoken with apes more polite then you.
guyozi103	I've seen fleas with bigger arms than yours!
guyozi104	Nothing on this earth can save your sorry hide!
guyozi105	Your mother wears a toupee!
guyozi106	I hope you have a boat ready for a quick escape.
guyozi107	When your father first saw you, he must have been mortified.
guyozi108	Only once have I met such a coward!
guyozi109	You're as repulsive as a monkey in a negligee.
guyozi110	With your breath, I'm sure they all suffocated.
guyozi111	Well, how do you know?  You don't have that many fingers!
guyozi112	I've got a little TIP for you, get the POINT?
guyozi113	With you around, I'd prefer to be fumigated.
guyozi114	Your mommy will have to peel me, first!
guyozi115	First you better stop waving it like a feather-duster.
guyozi116	I could, if you would use some breath spray.
guyozi117	How appropriate.  You fight like a cow.
guyozi118	Too bad no one's ever heard of YOU!
guyozi119	Then killing you must be justifiable fungicide.
guyozi120	Your father smelt of elderberries!
guyozi121	Even BEFORE they smell your breath?
guyozi122	Why? Are you studying to be a nurse?
guyozi123	I look THAT much like your fiancée?
guyozi124	I wanted to make sure you'd feel comfortable with me.
guyozi125	Yes, yes, I know, it's a three headed monkey.
guyozi126	I'm glad to hear you attended your family reunion.
guyozi127	THAT's why you've been scratching so furiously!
guyozi128	The only way you'll be preserved is formaldehyde.
guyozi129	Oh, that is so cliché!
guyozi130	Why, did you want to borrow one?
guyozi131	At least mine can be identified.
guyozi132	He must have taught you everything you know!
guyozi133	I don't need to prove anything to you, I know I'd win.
guyozi134	Could you repeat that?  I didn't hear what you said.
guyozi135	Oh, forget this.  I give up.
guyozi136	I'm back!
guyozi137	Why are you buying up all the land in the Caribbean?
guyozi138	You too?  What are yours like?
guyozi139	Gee.  Mine are mostly about ice cream.
guyozi140	Why are you trying to buy the Caribbean?
guyozi141	What's your beef with pirates?
guyozi142	Uh, yeah, right.
guyozi143	Is there anything else you hate about pirates?
guyozi144	Oh
guyozi145	Ah.
guyozi146	What's with all the dead animals?
guyozi147	Burbank?
guyozi148	Oh.
guyozi149	Hey, you're the jerk who hired Pegnose to frame me for the bank robbery!
guyozi150	Ha!
guyozi151	I overheard you talking to Pegnose in the swamp.
guyozi152	You heard me.  I know all about your scheme to steal the Marley heirlooms.
guyozi153	I already found it!
guyozi154	Um, yeah.
guyozi155	You're through, Mandrill! I can prove that you framed me!
guyozi156	Yeah.
guyozi157	My navigator tells me that you're pretty good with an insult.
guyozi158	I bet I can beat ya.
guyozi159	I'd like to take another shot at Insult Swordfighting.
guyozi160	Well, I'll be seeing you later.
guyozi161	That name sounds familiar...
guyozi162	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate!
guyozi163	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, zillionaire. I own a mansion and a yacht.
guyozi164	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, Monkey Wrangler!
guyozi165	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, the Love Machine of Mêlée Island™!
guyozi166	Who's playing?
guyozi167	Hey, you're the guy who's trying to buy out the SCUMM Bar!
guyozi168	Aren't you the forgotten member of a famous country-western singing clan?
guyozi169	Aren't you the over-the-top heavy metal performer who bites the heads off of monkeys?
guyozi170	You're the master of the pan flute, right?
guyozi171	Weren't you the one who was supposed to bring balance to the Force?
guyozi172	And how do all my pirate friends fit into your capitalist utopia?
guyozi173	Retrained?
guyozi174	But what about pirates who don't want to be waiters, janitors, and dishwashers?
guyozi175	And how do the dozens of pirate support industries fit into your scheme?
guyozi176	But what about the stores that won't sell out?
guyozi177	But what about the children?
guyozi178	I dunno.  I just thought I'd ask.
guyozi179	I'm tired of discussing your warped dreams.
guyozi180	If I win, you have to confess to Inspector Canard that you framed me.
guyozi181	If I win, you have to tell me all your secret evil plans.
guyozi182	If I win, you have to give me a million pieces of eight.
guyozi183	Or maybe eight million pieces of one.
guyozi184	If I win, you have to do the Chicken Dance in the middle of town.
guyozi185	On second thought, I don't want to fight you now.
guyozi186	It's very nice.  Lots of booty.
guyozi187	It's booty-tastic!
guyozi188	I thought there would be more chintz.
guyozi189	I thought the piled shag was a bit much.
guyozi190	As showrooms go, I'd rate it a 78.  It had a good beat, and I could dance to it.
guyozi191	It was one of the top five booty showrooms I've seen this year.
guyozi192	Huh!  Believe me, I've seen it.
guyozi193	Maybe I don't wanna tell you.
guyozi194	I'd better not...he's liable to have me thrown in jail.  Again.
guyozi195	Matched dueling swords.
guyozi196	There are more civilized ways to pick a fight.
guypac001	I better drop this boulder before I get a hernia.
guypac002	Normally a pile of rocks wouldn't be that interesting.  But these...
guypac003	No human would stack rocks like this!
guypac004	It's a rock.
guypac005	I should figure out where I want to throw it.
guypac006	There's got to be a better way to utilize this rock.
guypac007	There's an unusual canal cut into the side of the cliff here.
guypac008	That goes back to Monkey Island™.
guypac009	I think I should do something with this rock before I try to do anything else.
guypac010	Hmph.  I guess there aren't any more boulders on that ramp.
guypac011	I'm not about to dive into this canal.  I think that would hurt.
guypla001	Cool.
guypla002	Darn.
guypla003	It nice to see that good old-fashioned blackmail still works in some parts of this 'modern' world.
guypla004	Good.
guypla005	I... I wasn't that bad, was I?
guypla006	What does this guy have against me?
guypla007	Ugh.
guypla008	Eh, I guess the dunce cap worked.
guypla009	Lookin good.
guypla010	Rats.
guypla011	What happens now?
guypla012	Scissors, Rock, Paper?
guypla013	We'll just see about that, dive monkey!
guypla014	I wonder what that's all about?
guypla015	That doesn't sound pretty.
guypla016	Ewww.
guypla017	What Marco doesn't know is that we've replaced his regular Baby Seal Oil with StarBuccaneers™ Shmear Whiz.  Let's watch.
guypla018	Marcoooo!
guypla019	Marcoooo!
guypla020	Gee, I wonder how Elaine's doing?
guypla021	It's a brochure for Stan's Jambalaya Timeshare Emporium.
guypla022	Take a look at page three.
guypla023	I think your red-headed wife would be very interested to find out about the TIME you've been SHARING with this blonde, don't you?
guypla024	Really?  Huh... Well then I guess your wife won't mind if I show her the brochure.
guypla025	What's it worth to ya?
guypla026	Fine.  All I want is...a fair diving competition.
guypla027	Really.  Do we have a deal?
guypla028	Hi, guys.
guypla029	Eh, excuse me.
guypla030	What's going on around here?
guypla031	I'd like to take a crack at winning that diving trophy.
guypla032	Why?
guypla033	There won't be any word problems, will there?
guypla034	H... Hey, w... what're you doing with that?
guypla035	You're not gonna put that there, are you?
guypla036	Yeoooowch!
guypla037	...and another thing, I think the staple gun was completely uncalled for!
guypla038	Really?
guypla039	Nice trophy.
guypla040	Can I take a closer look at that trophy?
guypla041	I'm looking for the Ultimate Insult.
guypla042	No, it's an ancient voodoo talisman of indescribably horrible power!
guypla043	Are you guys sure you can't help me find the Ultimate Insult?
guypla044	I'm off.
guypla045	Pardon me.
guypla046	What was wrong with my last dive?
guypla047	Could you be more specific?
guypla048	I'd like to dive now.
guypla049	I'm looking for the Ultimate Insult.
guypla050	Why are you giving me such low scores?
guypla051	Not really.
guypla052	Whatever Mandrill's paying you to fix this contest, I'll double it!
guypla053	Think I'll leave you to your grouchiness.
guypla054	Pardon me.
guypla055	One of your judges is taking bribes!
guypla056	He told me he was taking bribes!
guypla057	What was wrong with my last dive?
guypla058	Well then why'd you give de Pollo a better score than me?
guypla059	Are you saying that my splashes are too big?
guypla060	Fish are aerodynamic?
guypla061	I'd like to dive now.
guypla062	I think de Pollo's cheating!
guypla063	I think he's smearing baby seal oil all over himself before he dives.
guypla064	It isn't.
guypla065	I don't need any.  My wife says that I'm naturally oily.
guypla066	I'm still looking for the Ultimate Insult.
guypla067	Aloha.
guypla068	Excuse me?
guypla069	Keelhaul: UP, got it.
guypla070	Rum Barrel: DOWN.  Check.
guypla071	Spinning Swordsman: RIGHT.  Okay.
guypla072	Alpha Monkey: LEFT.  Good.
guypla073	UP
guypla074	DOWN
guypla075	LEFT
guypla076	RIGHT
guypla077	What was wrong with my last dive?
guypla078	Say what?
guypla079	But how?
guypla080	Tell me again how to match de Pollo's moves.
guypla081	I'd like to dive now.
guypla082	I'm looking for the Ultimate Insult.
guypla083	See ya later.
guypla084	I'm back.
guypla085	Nice dive.
guypla086	P'shaw.  That was one of the best plank dives I've ever seen.
guypla087	My name is Guybrush Threepwood.  I'm a Mighty Pirate!
guypla088	So I noticed.
guypla089	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, plank diver!
guypla090	The name's Threepwood... Guybrush Threepwood.
guypla091	My name is unimportant.
guypla092	It's Guybrush Threepwood.
guypla093	Are you really the greatest diver in the world?
guypla094	How sad.
guypla095	What're you doing on Jambalaya Island™?
guypla096	Is it a SHORT story?
guypla097	Eww.
guypla098	Am I old enough to hear this?
guypla099	Makes sense to me.
guypla100	Has your arrangement with Ozzie Mandrill proven challenging?
guypla101	I'm looking for the pieces of the Ultimate Insult.
guypla102	How did you get into plank diving, anyway?
guypla103	Do you still dive to drown out the voices of the taunting children?
guypla104	That's good.  I'd hate to think there was something weird goin' on here.
guypla105	So, is this diving competition open to anyone?
guypla106	Oh.  So who DO you dive against?
guypla107	I'd like to dive against you.
guypla108	What's so funny?
guypla109	As serious as scurvy, diver-boy!
guypla110	Second greatest, you mean.
guypla111	Sure.  Check it out.
guypla112	Certified?
guypla113	Um, yes?
guypla114	I'm ready to dive against you now.
guypla115	Uh, no.
guypla116	I'd like to dive against you again.
guypla117	Why?  Are you afraid I'll beat you?
guypla118	I don't know...are you some kinda chicken?
guypla119	Marcooooo...Pollooooooo.
guypla120	I don't know the meaning of the word.
guypla121	I just remembered a previous engagement.  Bye.
guypla122	One of the pieces is a bronze hat.
guypla123	One of the pieces is a silver monkey head.
guypla124	One of the pieces is a golden man of some sort.
guypla125	Perhaps you're not the best person to ask about the Ultimate Insult.
guypla126	Are you kidding?  I LOVE stories rife with melancholy.
guypla127	Why the fuss?
guypla128	Pirates don't have much use for 'em.
guypla129	What a horrible story.
guypla130	Maybe later.
guypla131	It's the changing tent.
guypla132	I think they're the diving judges.
guypla133	They're the diving judges.
guypla134	It's that new chunky-style, lox flavored, baby seal oil I've heard so much about.
guypla135	Bosun and Bosun's baby seal oil.
guypla136	I'm assuming that this oil is meant to be USED on baby seals, rather than...
guypla137	Eww... no.
guypla138	Ewww...
guypla139	I think the owner of this oil would notice a big piece of bagel sitting in there.
guypla140	I don't see how that would help things.
guypla141	I don't know what to make of him.
guypla142	Isn't he the guy sworn to protect the golden child?
guypla143	Groovy, man.
guypla144	He calls himself a professional diver.
guypla145	I bet that I could beat him in a dive-off, any day.
guypla146	It goes back to the map.
guypla147	Whoops!
guypla148	I, uh, forgot something...
guypla149	Hey there.
guypla150	You better believe it.
guypla151	No, just showing off my certificate.
guypla152	I don't rightly know.
guypla153	Dirty little sky-rats.
guypla154	I don't wanna get bit.
guypla155	Shoo!  You filthy, flying poop factory!
guypla156	Nope.  That bird would steal it from me.
guypla165	While that might look nice, I'm a strong believer that only animate objects should wear necklaces.
guypla166	Thanks for the trophy.
guypla167	Can I keep diving?
guypla168	It's kind of fun!
guypla169	What happened to Marco de Pollo?
guypla170	It's kind of fun!
guypla171	You don't mean--?
guypla172	Hey, look!  Over there!
guypla173	They look really hungry.  No wonder.  I don't think there's any fish up here.
guyplt001	Excuse me?
guyplt002	'Free Pirate Caricature?'
guyplt003	Sure, why not?
guyplt004	No thanks.
guyplt005	I'm partial to the clang of a good sword fight.
guyplt006	Although sometimes, when the swords don't hit together cleanly, it makes this awful screeeech sound.
guyplt007	I love the smell of gunpowder in the morning.  Smells like...victory.
guyplt008	Of course, gunpowder in the late afternoon tends to smell a little more like week-old macaroni, which is why I always try to have my gun battles before lunch.
guyplt009	If you ask me, nothing can compare to the thrill of uncovering buried treasure.
guyplt010	But you should always be careful to lift from the legs, or else you could throw your back out.
guyplt011	On second thought, I'd rather not get caricatured right now.
guyplt012	I guess those peg legs ARE pretty funny looking...
guyplt013	Of course, most of those guys lost their legs to gangrene and sharks, so it's not really 'ha-ha' funny.
guyplt014	I've never met a pirate who didn't love his eye patch...
guyplt015	Although, I suppose they'd love to have their eyes back even more.
guyplt016	Nothing makes a bold fashion statement like a pirate with a parrot on his shoulder...
guyplt017	And most would agree that that statement is 'I'm a creepy jerk who tortures small animals for my personal amusement.'
guyplt018	On second thought, the notion of a crudely-drawn picture of me sounds like a really bad idea.
guyplt019	I shudder to think.
guyplt020	I guess not.
guyplt021	I think that most of them just like to curl up by the fire with a good book.
guyplt022	Of course, they usually just throw the book in the fire, but still...
guyplt023	Personally, I prefer to spend my weekends doing chores around the house.
guyplt024	No, really...it's quite relaxing.
guyplt025	If what I've heard is true, more and more pirates are spending their free time on the Internet.
guyplt026	I can't imagine anything a pirate would love more than coming down here to Planet Threepwood for a Mega Monkey Mug Meal!
guyplt027	On second thought, I don't want a picture drawn of me.  I'm afraid it'll steal my soul.
guyplt028	Thanks.
guyplt029	Murray?
guyplt030	Murray the Evil Skull?
guyplt031	Wow, it IS a small world, after all.
guyplt032	Hi, Murray.
guyplt033	How did you Escape from Monkey Island™?
guyplt034	The last time I saw you, you were sitting on a shelf in LeChuck's Demonic Amusement Park.
guyplt035	Oh, naturally.
guyplt036	So, after LeChuck escaped, how did you end up here?
guyplt037	Enough editorializing.  How'd you wind up here?
guyplt038	You know, the tale of your exodus wasn't particularly filled with 'heart-stopping malice and evil'.
guyplt039	Good point.
guyplt040	What are you doing here?
guyplt041	I can't imagine how you could be a very good bouncer.
guyplt042	Well, for starters, you've got no arms.
guyplt043	Impressive.  I don't imagine you get much repeat business, though.
guyplt044	So, how do you like this job?
guyplt045	Murray, what do you need money for?
guyplt046	How would you like to become an integral part of a powerful voodoo talisman?
guyplt047	Potentially.
guyplt048	The Ultimate Insult.
guyplt049	But I need a headpiece, and you'd be perfect, see?
guyplt050	I just thought...
guyplt051	Are you sure you don't want to be a part of the Ultimate Insult?
guyplt052	I've gotta go.
guyplt053	It was those hydrogen-filled LeChuck balloons, right?  I knew they were trouble.
guyplt054	I KNEW I should have given him a shave before I left!
guyplt055	But what caused the 'explosive blast of demonic heckfire'?
guyplt056	Was it an unfortunate accident at Largo's Burrito Bar?
guyplt057	Did the Anti-Matterhorn finally rip a whole in the space-time continuum, as predicted by most reputable scientists?
guyplt058	Eh, pardon me.
guyplt059	You're a little goofy-looking for a pirate, aren't you?
guyplt060	Aren't you afraid of encountering REAL pirates?
guyplt061	What would you say if I told you were looking at a real pirate right now?
guyplt062	But I AM a real pirate!  I'm Guybrush Threepwood!
guyplt063	Wow, I'm scarier than I thought.
guyplt064	I'm looking for the pieces of the Ultimate Insult.
guyplt065	No, it's a volatile voodoo talisman of indescribably psyche-destroying power!
guyplt066	I'm trying to stop an undead evil pirate from assembling it.
guyplt067	I'm still looking for the Ultimate Insult.
guyplt068	I'll just be on my way.
guyplt069	One of the pieces looks like a golden man.
guyplt070	I don't think that's it.
guyplt071	One of the pieces looks like a bronze pirate hat.
guyplt072	One of the pieces looks like a silver monkey head.
guyplt073	You think the Silver Monkey Mug is one of the pieces, eh?
guyplt074	I've had just about enough talking about the Ultimate Insult for now.
guyplt075	Excuse me?
guyplt076	I'd love to hear about today's special.
guyplt077	Eww.
guyplt078	What kind of place is this, anyway?
guyplt079	Ah.  That explains why it looks like my life has been vomited all over the walls.
guyplt080	I'M Guybrush Threepwood, and I'm not too thrilled about this place.
guyplt081	What?
guyplt082	No, really, I can prove it.
guyplt083	Ask me something only Guybrush Threepwood would know!
guyplt084	So, who are YOU supposed to be?
guyplt085	Hey, baby, you can be my Elaine any time.
guyplt086	Ah, nothing.
guyplt087	Whose brilliant idea was this, anyway?
guyplt088	I should have guessed.
guyplt089	I think I'm ready to order.
guyplt090	So, what's it like being married to a diving judge?
guyplt091	You're married to one of the diving judges, aren't you?
guyplt092	Isn't this a picture of you and your husband sharing a cozy moment in a time share bungalow built for two?
guyplt093	Uh, but--
guyplt094	Okay.
guyplt095	I'm looking for the Ultimate Insult.
guyplt096	I don't think so.
guyplt097	Come to think of it, I need a few more minutes.
guyplt098	I didn't.
guyplt099	I guess not.
guyplt100	John and Martha?
guyplt101	George and Gracie?
guyplt102	Herman and Eloise?
guyplt103	Mister and Mrs. Threepwood?
guyplt104	I think I'll have the Swordmaster's Delight.
guyplt105	Guybrush's Mighty Pirate Burger Sounds Good.
guyplt106	I'll take my chances with the Lobster LeChuck.
guyplt107	I'll have the special.
guyplt108	Maybe I should take another look at the menu.
guyplt109	What've you got?
guyplt110	Gee, she's just as snippy as the REAL Elaine.
guyplt111	Largo's Lemonade will be fine.
guyplt112	I'll have a Phatt Phizz.
guyplt113	Just a water, please.
guyplt114	Why should I pay?  This place wouldn't exist if it weren't for me!
guyplt115	I was thinking of running a tab.
guyplt116	Um, yeah.
guyplt117	I, uh, don't have any money.
guyplt118	Check out this Mega Monkey Meal ticket!
guyplt119	But I want one with me and the Monkey Muuuug!
guyplt120	I guess I should go sit down.
guyplt121	Whoa!  Look at the size of her...
guyplt122	Ponytail!
guyplt123	Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but it sure hasn't flattened this wage slave.
guyplt124	I'm already married to Elaine, why would I want a cheap copy?
guyplt125	I think I'm supposed to present this after I order some food.
guyplt126	I think he's supposed to be an artist or something.
guyplt127	He looks fascinated by all this stuff.
guyplt128	Oh my.  Elaine is going to have a fit if she sees this.  They made her look fat!
guyplt129	Why?  I have the real thing at home.  Guh huh heh.
guyplt130	'Planet Threepwood' -- This is just surreal.
guyplt131	If it belongs anywhere, it belongs right where it is.
guyplt132	Bet there's someone here when a customer tries to leave, though.
guyplt133	If anyone should eat here for free...
guyplt134	Great chefs of the Tri-Island Area.
guyplt135	Stainless Steel Chef, Copper Chef, Tin Chef...
guyplt136	Never heard of any of these guys.
guyplt137	Planet Threepwood has won the 'Golden Fish Award in Jambalaya Town'.  Nice.
guyplt138	Stealing awards just isn't the same as winning them yourself.
guyplt139	'The Best (and only) Fish -- Planet Threepwood'.  This place must be good.
guyplt140	Looks like they managed to get their hands on some of Elaine's stuff...
guyplt141	Glove, music box, plastic ice cream cone... Elaine's gonna have an aneurysm when she finds out about this.
guyplt142	At least this place has a bar.
guyplt143	Hey, that's a picture of the cursed ring from the last game... wonder how they got that.  And that duck-shaped floatation device.
guyplt144	That stuff caused me enough trouble already.
guyplt145	I wonder if Murray knows that they have his arm on display in here.
guyplt146	Oh... my... gosh.
guyplt147	Somebody stole my original pirate clothes out of my closet!!
guyplt148	LucasArts™ seems to have their grubby hands into everything around here.
guyplt149	I get the feeling that this LucasArts™ organization is controlling everything that happens in the Tri-Island Area...
guyplt150	I guess they couldn't find anything else interesting when they were stealing stuff out of my closet.
guyplt151	They've got my name on them... just like my underwear.
guyplt152	I've got a shirt.
guyplt153	On today's menu is Swordmaster's Delight, Guybrush's Mighty Pirate Burger, Lobster LeChuck, and Elaine's Sea-sar Salad.
guyplt154	Big mighty pirates like myself can't live on salads!
guyplt155	Today's special drinks are Largo's Lemonade and Phatt Phizz.
guyplt156	I should talk to the waitress if I want to order something.
guyplt157	I wonder what the secret is... ah, who cares anyway.
guyplt158	I'm sitting down.
guyplt159	Uuhhh... I wasn't going to keep it, really!
guyplt160	I don't think it would help me get the real thing if I gave this to her now.
guyplt161	Heck no!  After all the trouble I've gone through to get this thing in the first place, she'll have to pry it from my cold dead fingers if she wants it back!
guyplt162	There's nobody here.
guypop001	Dave?
guypop002	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!
guypop003	What?!
guypop004	WHAT?
guypop005	Wow, you're good...
guypop006	It's me!  Your Uncle Freddie!
guypop007	What do you mean?  Don't you recognize me?
guypop008	Okay, you got me.  My name is Guybrush Threepwood.
guypop009	Who are you?
guypop010	So how's the prosthetics business?
guypop011	Let me guess:  An Australian land developer is using strong-arm tactics to try and buy up your business.
guypop012	Well, I just figured--
guypop013	Never mind.  So, what IS wrong with your business?
guypop014	Have you heard from your filing monkey since he disappeared?
guypop015	Uh--
guypop016	Not to be insensitive, but are you blind?
guypop017	I don't know...the twin eye patches could be some sort of hip new pirate fashion statement.
guypop018	Sorry.
guypop019	You can recognize people by their smell?
guypop020	So, how sharp is your hearing, anyway?  Baldy.
guypop021	I'm looking for some gifts for my differently-abled pirate friends.
guypop022	I still need to find some St. Swithens Day gifts for my friends.
guypop023	Pegnose Pete.
guypop024	Not that I know of.
guypop025	I'm looking for a no-nosed pirate thief.
guypop026	Thieves?
guypop027	Really?
guypop028	I'm still looking for a no-nosed pirate.
guypop029	Are you sure you don't know Pegnose Pete's alias?
guypop030	See you later.
guypop031	That's terrible.
guypop032	And you're so despondent over your loss that you can't focus on your work, right?
guypop033	Then why was he so important?
guypop034	And without a monkey to carve your prostheses, your business is suffering, right?
guypop035	Then why do you miss him so much?
guypop036	And without a monkey to guide you around the shop, you're essentially paralyzed, right?
guypop037	Okay, I'll bite:  What was so important about your missing monkey?
guypop038	How about something in a fashionable pegleg?
guypop039	That'd be great... if I had any money.
guypop040	What kind of hooks are the cool pirates wearing this season?
guypop041	That's a little bit out of my range.
guypop042	What have you got in affordable prosthetic hands?
guypop043	Gee, that does sound good.  I almost wish I was carrying some money.
guypop044	Frankly, I'm in the market for a prosthetic nose.
guypop045	What've you got that's free?
guypop046	What can I say, I'm broke.
guypop047	Neat.  What kind of prosthetic devices are we talking about?
guypop048	Huh?
guypop049	I'd like to have another one of those free prostheses.
guypop050	On second thought, I think I'll just browse for a while.
guypop051	Jerry?
guypop052	Larry?
guypop053	Harry?
guypop054	Mindy?
guypop055	Cindy?
guypop056	Wendy?
guypop057	Well?
guypop058	What happened?
guypop059	What a dreadful story.
guypop060	That story's worse than the last one.
guypop061	You really should leave the story-telling to the professionals.
guypop062	What is it?
guypop063	Ah, couldn't handle the grog?
guypop064	How do you plan on duplicating the intricate thought processes of the pirate brain?
guypop065	Oh, gross!
guypop066	Oh, double gross!
guypop067	Ewww.
guypop068	I repeat: Ewww.
guypop069	But why?
guypop070	You already gave me one of those.

guypop199	It's some sort of document.
guypop200	That creepy-looking guy has patches over both of his eyes!
guypop201	Sorry.
guypop202	It's the guy who runs the Palace of Prostheses.
guypop203	It's Deadeye Dave.
guypop204	Hey, does the smell in this hanky remind you of anything or anybody?
guypop205	Whaddya mean?!  I thought blind peoples'...
guypop206	Sorry.  I thought VISUALLY CHALLENGED peoples' other senses become enhanced to offset the lack of vision.
guypop207	I mean, I have a fully functioning set of eyes and even I can smell the foul odor coming off this hanky!
guypop208	Like how?!
guypop209	Really?!  He's my... uuh... really good friend... yeah.
guypop210	I lost track of him, and uuh... missed him so much that I made a little odor potion to remind me of him.
guypop211	Well, anyways, if you know where I can find my... uh... friend, that'd be very helpful!
guypop212	Well, let's go get that file!
guypop213	What a coincidence!  I already have Pegnose's file.
guypop214	I must have psychic powers!
guypop215	Sorry, but I want to be sure of this.  Who'd you say this smell belonged to?
guypop216	Thanks.
guypop217	That's the grabber that takes the files from the back.
guypop218	There's no file on the grabber right now.
guypop219	No, I need these directions to find Pegnose's hideout.
guypop220	These are the controls for the file retrieval system.
guypop221	I already have one of Deadeye's customer files.  If I want another, I better put this one back.
guypop222	I already have Pegnose's file.
guypop223	Hmm... I guess there's no file with these settings.
guypop224	Ah, forget it.
guypop225	It's a basket of finely-crafted prosthetic limbs.
guypop226	I don't need an entire basket of prosthetic limbs.
guypop227	At most, I might need one.
guypop228	It appears to be some sort of hi-tech file retrieval system.
guypop229	I wish they'd stop staring at me.
guypop230	I've had enough of touching other people's eyeballs, thanks.
guypop231	I haven't seen so many pointy things in one place since my last dental check-up.
guypop232	Sticking my hand into a basket full of hooks seems like a recipe for disaster.
guypop233	These hooks and hands look like they're falling apart.
guypop234	As much as I love free stuff, these plastic doo-dads are useless.
guypop235	What a great idea!  Pity about the elephants, though.
guypop236	I make it a rule to boycott things made from endangered animals that I didn't personally kill.
guypop237	I've seen the literature on these things.  They're supposed to make great Julienned Fries.
guypop238	I think I'd just injure myself with that.
guypop239	Ah, the classic cast-iron hook, favored by vicious pirates the world over.
guypop240	I don't think so.  Elaine gets angry enough when my beard scratches her face.
guypop241	Actually, I don't have a dime...
guypop242	Nope, just the haunting melodies of my music box.
guypop243	It's a false leg made of...porcelain.  Ewwww.
guypop244	I'm not touching that.
guypop245	Let's see...rubber knuckles...artificial appendages...faux follicles...nope, nothing I want here.
guypop246	That goes out to Lucre town.
guypop247	No thanks.  I went through too much trouble to get it.
guypop248	Do you mind if I turn this on?
guypop249	I SAID DO YOU MIND IF I TURN THIS ON?
guypop250	Hmm.  Guess not.
guypph001	He really doesn't seem to like ducks.
guypph002	Watching Pegnose's panic attacks is fun, but I'm sure I could do better.
guypph003	I can hear some people talking inside.
guypph004	If I move closer to the window, maybe I'll be able to make out what they're saying...
guypph005	Hmm... this should be good.
guypph006	Hey, that voice sounds familiar!
guypph007	Impenetrable secret cave?  I thought those had all been shut down.
guypph008	So, Ozzie and Pegnose are working together.  After I deal with Pegnose here, I'll have to pay Mister Mandrill a little visit.
guypph009	So, Pegnose is working with that Mandrill guy from the bank.  After I deal with Pegnose here, I'll have to pay Mister Mandrill a little visit.
guypph010	I'm Captain of the raft!
guypph011	You can make me do a lot of dumb things, but I refuse to carry that raft.
guypph012	This is somebody else's raft.
guypph013	Nope.
guypph014	Nah, I like my raft better.
guypph015	I bet a WHOLE lotta crawdaddies would fit in this trap.
guypph016	And I bet it doesn't catch many either, with gaps THAT big between the bars.
guypph017	No thanks, I'll get my crawdaddies at the restaurant.
guypph018	Funny, I don't feel welcome.
guypph019	That wouldn't be very neighborly.
guypph020	That's a very slippery welcome mat.
guypph021	I'm not going to get too close.  Wouldn't want Pegnose to see me.
guypph022	There's no glass.  There's nothing to open.
guypph023	Ha... I don't think so.  You're going to jail, bucko!
guypph024	That's the door to Pegnose's shack.
guypph025	If I just go barging in there, Pegnose will shoot me!
guypph026	Pegnose must brew his own rum.
guypph027	Uh, no thanks.  I prefer to drink rum that's been prepared by people with fully-functioning nasal equipment.
guypph028	Pegnose must catch his own fish.
guypph029	No thanks.  If I need stinky old fish, I'll go to the bait shop.
guypph030	I don't want to catch any crawdaddies...besides, I don't think this is crawdaddy bait.
guypph031	Nah, this is more of a free-range duck.
guypta001	This could take awhile...why don't you come back later?
guypta002	That doesn't seem fair.
guypta003	Sorry, ma'am.
guypta004	Yes, Miss Rivers?
guypta005	Yes?
guypta006	Wow!
guypta007	Hmm.  Not much of a graduation ceremony.
guypta008	Really?
guypta009	Hmm.  That didn't get me anywhere.
guypta010	Yeah, I may be a dunce, but at least I'm a Mighty Pirate Dunce.
guypta011	I politely inform the stranger of the correct time.
guypta012	I brush the stranger off with a scowl.
guypta013	I push the stranger to the ground, and tell him to get out of my face.
guypta014	I disembowel the stranger with a dagger, hide his body in a nearby alley, and take his wallet!
guypta015	I walk away...you don't wanna get involved with something like that.
guypta016	Taking advantage of their mutual distraction, I impale both men on my trusty sword, and steal their gold!
guypta017	I try to help the guy who's losing.
guypta018	I look for a cop...they're the professionals.
guypta019	I hunt down and kill everyone who's ever checked out the book...
guypta020	Then, after I kill their families, their friends, and their pets, I seek out the treasure!
guypta021	Arrr!
guypta022	I look for everyone who's ever checked out the book...
guypta023	So I can find out who the map belongs to.
guypta024	I put the map back in the book, and put the book back on its proper place on the shelf when I'm done with it.
guypta025	I inform the librarian of the situation.  It's her job to handle crises like this.
guypta026	Eh, I go home and eat some ice cream.
guypta027	I say nasty things about her behind her back.
guypta028	I get on with my life.
guypta029	I transform myself into an undead creature of unrelenting evil, terrorizing the seven seas in my never-ending quest to make her my bride!
guypta030	Arr-arr-arrrrrr!
guypta031	I burn the restaurant to the ground, and string the chef up by his kidneys!
guypta032	Yah hah ha haaah!
guypta033	I raise a big stink, questioning the ancestry of the chef and the entire staff!
guypta034	I politely send the burger back to the chef.
guypta035	I quietly eat the burger, thankful for the sustenance.
guypta036	I sail past the ship...it's not my problem if it sinks.
guypta037	I dump the toys, hoist the Jolly Roger, plunder the ship, decapitate their captain, and set fire to the bloody husk!
guypta038	I ask the ship's captain if he needs any help.
guypta039	I'll be lucky if I can avoid running INTO the ship.
guypta040	I take my friend aside and gently let him know how much his teasing hurts me, personally.
guypta041	I fire back with a haiku about his appalling body odor.
guypta042	Eh, I chuckle along with everyone else.
guypta043	I shave his belly with a rusty razor, all the while shouting 'I got your haircut right HERE, Spanky!'
guypta044	I organize a mutiny among the crew, all the while deciding which ones I'll eat if the mutiny fails.
guypta045	I... I try to persuade the captain that travelling into the Triangle is a really bad idea.
guypta046	To appease the gods of the Triangle, I make a blood sacrifice of the cabin boy.
guypta047	I brush off my irrational fears of the Triangle with a laugh, and return to my duties.
guypta048	I just say 'No' to grog.
guypta049	I politely decline, but offer to buy the stranger's next drink.
guypta050	I join my new best friend in an extended round of binge-grogging.
guypta051	I accept the grog, poison his own, and steal his treasure.
guypta052	Arrrrr!
guypta053	I have to go to the bathroom.
guypta054	Believe me, it's worth it.
guypta055	Ummm...
guypta056	Now I remember why I dropped out of school.
guypta057	I'm surprised she fell for that again.
guypta058	It's a good thing that Miss Rivers' short term memory seems to be on the fritz.
guypta059	I wonder how many times I can get away with this.
guypta060	Oooh, free goodies!
guypta061	Eww... It's Mungle's chewing tobacco.
guypta062	No thanks.  I've got enough bad habits as it is.
guypta063	Nothin' in here but a gross wad of tissue.
guypta064	There's just a used tissue in here.  I don't want that.
guypta065	Hmm... let's see what the reading selection is like...
guypta066	'Captain Bloodbeard Gets a Shave.'
guypta067	'Spurious Jorge Walks the Plank'
guypta068	'The Little Galleon that Could'
guypta069	'Snow White and the Seven Brigands'
guypta070	I'm surprised they don't have 'Hook, Hook, Peg Leg, Patch.'
guypta071	Although the pictures are pretty, these books are too remedial for my sophisticated tastes.
guypta072	Someone spat on this sign.
guypta073	I already am using it by not spitting.
guypta074	It's the time out stool for bad pirates.
guypta075	I'm not a bad pirate.
guypta076	It's one of those controversial new 'ball-maps' of the world.
guypta077	My pants are already pretty controversial...I don't need to add crackpot pseudo-science to the mix.
guypta078	Hmmm.  If I couldn't read, how would I obey this sign?
guypta079	Nice, wholesome, non-threatening, little, colored blocks.
guypta080	No, too wholesome and non-threatening for me.
guypta081	Pretty flowers.
guypta082	I've had enough flower picking for one adventure.
guypta083	Toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat.
guypta084	It's too small for me.
guypta085	'No swearing.'
guypta086	Fiddle-faddle!
guypta087	Dang!
guypta088	Heck!
guypta089	Darn!
guypta090	Jeez!
guypta091	Gosh Darnit!
guypta092	Dag Nabbit!
guypta093	Monkey Knuckles!
guypta094	Ahh, Cow Cakes!
guypta095	Ah, Phlegm Nuggets!
guypta096	Shucks!
guypta097	A B C D E F Z... C-A-T... D-O-G... S-C-U-R-V-Y?
guypta098	I'd rather not carry around magnets...they could corrupt my memory.
guypta099	It's a picture of a happy pirate holding a flower, rendered in a primitive waxy medium.
guypta100	I wonder if it's a picture of Otis.
guypta101	If I want a waxy painting, I'll talk to Meathook.
guypta102	'Learning is good.'
guypta103	Looks like someone's Emily Eyepatch doll got confiscated.
guypta104	It's a Baby Buccaneer Brand slingshot.
guypta105	It's a toy cannon.
guypta106	What tiny desks.
guypta107	No way.  I'm not cramming my body into those until it's absolutely necessary.
guypta108	She reminds me of my dear old granny...
guypta109	...my dear old, bipolar, scaring-the-neighbors granny.
guypta110	If I'm such a dunce, how'd I manage to get this certificate of transmogrification?
guypta111	Oh yeah?  Well I never intended to use this thing, anyway!  So there!
guypta112	Look!  It's me!  Your star pupil!
guypta113	It's been great!
guypta114	I've only committed three acts of petty theft since getting my certificate!
guypta115	I'd rather not give Miss Rivers an excuse to confiscate my cool, piratey stuff.
guypta116	That door leads to the not-so-great outdoors.
guypta117	I'm no dunce.
guysco001	Well, that didn't seem to work.
guysco002	I think I'm getting close.
guysco003	Whoops.
guysco004	Sorry about that!
guysco005	Perhaps I'm not doing this quite right.
guysco006	That didn't seem to do anything useful.
guysco007	Bullseye!
guysco008	Bingo!
guysco009	Splash!
guysco010	Looks like I landed that rock right in the lava stream.
guysco011	Someone has conveniently left this pile of rocks here.
guysco012	This one doesn't look too heavy.
guysco013	It heads back down the hill.
guyscu001	I guess he won't be needing these anymore.
guyscu002	I guess he doesn't want anyone taking his birthday pretzels.
guyscu003	What's your name?
guyscu004	How would you like to join my crew of mighty pirates, Mister Cheese?
guyscu005	He's out cold.
guyscu006	It's one of Mêlée's colorful chemically-dependent seafaring scalawags.
guyscu007	Hey, how's the weather down there?
guyscu008	I challenge you to another round of Insult Arm Wrestling, you big-armed freak!
guyscu009	Can I get a pretzel refill?
guyscu010	Oh, umm.. never mind.
guyscu011	That looks like a pirate with a lot on his mind.
guyscu012	That's Ignatius Cheese, a crusty old navigator.
guyscu013	Ah.
guyscu014	Wait a minute.  Your name is 'I. Cheese'?
guyscu015	It's a dartboard.
guyscu016	Personally, I can't think of anything scarier than a horde of drunken pirates flinging pointy missiles all over the place.
guyscu017	I'll have you know that the Threepwood name has a long and noble history.
guyscu018	I'd like to hear about the 'long and noble history' of the Cheese family.
guyscu019	Who was that?
guyscu020	Why don't people EVER want me to go into the kitchen?
guyscu021	The human body is a beautiful thing...
guyscu022	...most of the time.  Eeewwwhh.
guyscu023	That's the kind of painting that drives pirates to drink.
guyscu024	Hey, I can see my house from here!
guyscu025	...I hope it's still there when I get back from Lucre Island™.
guyscu026	Yup, the mansion's still there.
guyscu027	Our rented honeymoon ship has already pulled out of the harbor.
guyscu028	It's just as well...it was too expensive for short trips.
guyscu029	Wait a minute...
guyscu030	Ooops.
guyscu031	That's the skull of Hermie, the Giant Sea Pig of Mêlée Island™.
guyscu032	His ribs tasted like pork, his shanks like salmon, and his giblets like yams.
guyscu033	It's comforting to know that Hermie's hollowed skull guards this hallowed bar.
guyscu034	I'm back.
guyscu035	Hail and hello, o' Master of all things grog-like.
guyscu036	Eh, Threepwood.
guyscu037	This place is quieter than a crypt full of mimes.
guyscu038	Australian?
guyscu039	Wow.
guyscu040	Do you know anything more about this Australian developer?
guyscu041	How'd you like to join a crew of courageous pirates on a dangerous quest?
guyscu042	Great!
guyscu043	Are you sure you can't join my crew?
guyscu044	You got any snacks?
guyscu045	Well, that seems harmless enough.
guyscu046	Eugh.
guyscu047	Got anything else?
guyscu048	Okay.  Let's have some.
guyscu049	What!?  Why did you...
guyscu050	Can't you give them to me without a basket?
guyscu051	Are you sure I can't just have a few pretzels?
guyscu052	You're probably right.
guyscu053	Can I get a refill on these pretzels?
guyscu054	I guess I'm just a sucker for the taste of twisted kudu.
guyscu055	But I want mooore.
guyscu056	Grog me, barkeep!
guyscu057	No, really, grog me!
guyscu058	I've got troubles.
guyscu059	I've still got troubles.
guyscu060	I've gotta go.
guyscu061	Me too.
guyscu062	Some bozo named Charles L. Charles is trying to have my house destroyed.
guyscu063	Say what?
guyscu064	The thought of Charles still gets my knickers in a bunch.
guyscu065	The government is trying to blow up my house.
guyscu066	Yeah, if anyone's gonna blow up my house, it should be me!
guyscu067	I haven't got a crew to take me to Lucre Island™.
guyscu068	I've got a crew, but I need a navigator.
guyscu069	Thanks.
guyscu070	I've got a navigator, but I need a crew.
guyscu071	My dreams are filled with absurd, Fellini-esque images of fascistic despair.
guyscu072	But you haven't given me any grog.
guyscu073	I need a ship to take me to Lucre Island™.
guyscu074	Does Stan still work there?
guyscu075	'Harbor...mistress?'
guyscu076	If that's her tender side, I wish she'd keep it to herself.
guyscu077	Where'd you say I could find a ship?
guyscu078	Got it, thanks.
guyscu079	I've got a ship, but I remain troubled about the devaluation of the human spirit in this increasingly technological age.
guyscu080	Really?
guyscu081	Are you sure that your grog hasn't gone bad?
guyscu082	On second thought, I hate listening to myself whine.
guyscu083	ID? I don't got to show you no stinkin' ID!
guyscu084	Since when do groggeries check for ID?
guyscu085	I, uh, left it in my other pants.
guyscu086	But I like these pants.
guyscu087	What, don't I look like I'm 14?
guyscu088	But Charles is trying to destroy my wife's mansion!
guyscu089	That's gotta be a crime, right?
guyscu090	A roller coaster?  That sounds familiar...
guyscu091	That's pretty compelling...
guyscu092	But Charles is a scheming demagogue!
guyscu093	I bet he's just telling you what you want to hear!
guyscu094	Okay, you've got me there...
guyscu095	But Charles isn't a real pirate!
guyscu096	How can an effete snob like Charles hope to relate to the hopes and desires of a swashbuckling community like Mêlée Island™?
guyscu097	Well, I can't argue with that...
guyscu098	But Charles stinks!
guyscu099	I mean he really smells!  He's got flies buzzing around him and everything!
guyscu100	That's true...
guyscu101	Maybe we should just agree to disagree about our politics.
guyscu102	Hi there, fellow swashbuckler.
guyscu103	What's the word on the street?
guyscu104	Got any more juicy nuggets of info?
guyscu105	How would you like to join my crew on a dangerous piratey mission?
guyscu106	Are you sure you don't want to join my crew?
guyscu107	What's that you're drinking?
guyscu108	So, what're you drinking now?
guyscu109	Say, mind if I have some of your pretzels?
guyscu110	You sure I can't have any of your pretzels?
guyscu111	You look like a busy man.  I'll let you get back to your self-destructive binge drinking.
guyscu112	Gesundheit.
guyscu113	We'll be searching the seven seas for sunken treasure.
guyscu114	I'll take that as a 'no,' then.
guyscu115	Like I said, we'll be looking for sunken treasure.
guyscu116	Jeez, for a pirate you really hate water.
guyscu117	We'll be pillaging a small coastal village.
guyscu118	Hmmm... not a big fish fan, eh?
guyscu119	Like I said, it'll be your standard loot-n-pillage spree.
guyscu120	Yeah, I guess it does sound kind of immoral.
guyscu121	We'll be heading to Lucre Island™ to meet with my wife's lawyers.
guyscu122	You're right, that does sound sort of silly when I say it out loud.
guyscu123	Like I said, we'll be looking for lawyers.
guyscu124	LIVING lawyers.
guyscu125	Let me get back to you on that.
guyscu126	Yup.
guyscu127	Ahoy again, mateys!
guyscu128	Ahoy mateys!
guyscu129	You're in a bar.  You're playing darts.  This is busy?
guyscu130	Yeah, busy making holes in the walls.
guyscu131	Well, aren't you two friendly?
guyscu132	Okay. See ya.
guyscu133	I'm a dart-throwing maniac!
guyscu134	Back in grade school, they called me 'The Dartmaster'!
guyscu135	Or something that rhymed with that, anyway...
guyscu136	So... Can I join your game?
guyscu137	Why are there so many holes in the wall around the dartboard?
guyscu138	Get out of here.
guyscu139	I bet you can't hit another one on the first shot.
guyscu140	Would you strapping young specimens like to join my pirate crew?
guyscu141	Are you sure you won't join my crew?
guyscu142	Why aren't you playing 'Insult Dart Throwing'?
guyscu143	Who's winning?
guyscu144	Who's winning now?
guyscu145	Well, I guess I'll be shovin' off now.
guyscu146	Me too.
guyscu147	I bet you can't hit that balloon over there.
guyscu148	I bet you can't get a bullseye.
guyscu149	Hit a triple 8.
guyscu150	Try to hit a four.
guyscu151	How about a 2?
guyscu152	Land one right in the eye of that skull over the door.
guyscu153	How 'bout that post on the right side of the screen?
guyscu154	I bet you can't hit that guy over there.
guyscu155	There's no way you'll be able to hit the center of that life preserver on the kitchen door.
guyscu156	Can you hit the big stuffed fish over there?
guyscu157	Never mind, I believe you.
guyscu158	Nah, I've seen enough.
guyscu159	Oh, yeah!?
guyscu160	NOT.
guyscu161	I am rubber, you are glue...
guyscu162	I'm shakin'!  I'm shakin'!
guyscu163	Shyea!
guyscu164	How appropriate.  You fight like a cow.
guyscu165	You're a big poopie head!
guyscu166	You suck!
guyscu167	Dummy!
guyscu168	You're not very nice!
guyscu169	Oh, please.  You call THAT an insult?
guyscu170	Can't you think of anything better?
guyscu171	You're not really trying very hard, are you?
guyscu172	Ungh, grrr, ha, gyaaa...
guyscu173	Today, by myself, twelve people I've beaten.
guyscu174	I've got muscles in places you've never even heard of.
guyscu175	Give up now, or I'll crush you like a grape!
guyscu176	My ninety-eight year old grandmother has bigger arms than you!
guyscu177	I'm going to put your arm in a sling!
guyscu178	My stupefying strength will shatter your ulna into a million pieces!
guyscu179	Hey, look over there!
guyscu180	Your knuckles I'll grind to a splintery paste.
guyscu181	Your arms are no bigger than fleas that I've met!
guyscu182	People consider my fists lethal weapons!
guyscu183	Only once have I met such a coward!
guyscu184	You're the ugliest creature I've ever seen in my life.
guyscu185	My forearms have been mistaken for tree trunks!
guyscu186	I've out-wrestled octopi with these arms!
guyscu187	Do I see quivers of agony dance on your lip?
guyscu188	From the size of your gut, I'd guess they were eaten.
guyscu189	It's too bad none of them are in your arms.
guyscu190	I would if it would stop your WINE-ING.
guyscu191	Yeah, but we've both got better bladder control than you do.
guyscu192	Why, ya studying to be a nurse?
guyscu193	I'm surprised you can count that high!
guyscu194	Yeah, yeah, I know: it's a three headed monkey.
guyscu195	I thought that the bean dip had a strange taste.
guyscu196	So THAT'S why you're scratching...I'd go see a vet.
guyscu197	Sadly, your breath should be equally reckoned.
guyscu198	He must have taught you everything you know.
guyscu199	I'm shocked that you've never gazed at your wife.
guyscu200	An over-the-counter defoliant could help with that problem.
guyscu201	I'm sure that spineless creatures everywhere are humbled by your might.
guyscu202	It's laughter that's caused by your feathery grip.
guyscu203	I won!
guyscu204	I don't wanna play anymore.
guyscu205	Could you repeat that?
guyscu206	I give up!
guyscu207	I quit.
guyscu208	Me too.
guyscu209	Hello again, Mister Cheese.
guyscu210	Hi there, scruffy looking pirate person.  I'm Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate.
guyscu211	It says 'Happy Birthday'.
guyscu212	Nah, it's probably the only thing this poor guy has to his name.
guyscu213	Are you sure you don't want to join my crew of mighty pirates?
guyscu214	Is there something I could do to convince you to navigate my ship to Lucre Island™?
guyscu215	Are you sure there's nothing I can do to convince you to navigate my ship to Lucre Island™?
guyscu216	That's the bartender.
guyscu217	You're on.
guyscu218	Are you looking forward to sailing to Lucre Island™?
guyscu219	What big arms you have, Mister Cheese.
guyscu220	Tell me again about this thing you call 'Insult Arm Wrestling.'
guyscu221	Maybe it's just me, but playing darts without a shirt seems like an invitation to trouble.
guyscu222	Must be hard to play darts when you can't reach the top of the dartboard.
guyscu223	Cheese?
guyscu224	I'm sorry, but I just can't get over the absurdity of your name.
guyscu225	It's the oh so dangerous SCUMM Bar dartboard.
guyscu226	This fish has seen better days.
guyscu227	It's the door to the kitchen.
guyscu228	I don't ride many carriages in my line of work, sorry.
guyscu229	Tell me more about the family Cheese.
guyscu230	What's he famous for?
guyscu231	Let me guess...
guyscu232	Swiss Cheese?
guyscu233	Really?  What does he do?
guyscu234	Give me a second...
guyscu235	Blue Cheese?
guyscu236	How ugly was she?
guyscu237	It's probably unwise to dwell on the curious fact that I can SEE the harbor from this window.
guyscu238	um
guyscu239	Nope, I'm drawing a blank.
guyscu240	Argh.  I think I've curd enough about your family.
guyscu241	It's been nice chatting, but I've got to see a man about a monkey.
guyscu242	You'd be helping a band of bloodthirsty brigands sack a small fishing village!
guyscu243	Like I said, we're planning to plunder a piscatorial port.
guyscu244	You'd be looking for sunken treasure with a group of cutthroat killing-machines.
guyscu245	As I mentioned, we'll be scouring seabeds for soggy stolen shekels.
guyscu246	You'd be travelling to Lucre Island™ with a crew of cretinous buccaneers to meet with my wife's lawyers.
guyscu247	Really?
guyscu248	But what?
guyscu249	Let me think about that for a moment.
guyscu250	You're the owner of the SCUMM Bar!?
guyscu251	Why not?
guyscu252	Why not?  Have you lost your nerve?
guyscu253	Well then, why can't you join my crew?
guyscu254	Why not?  Is your keister glued to that chair?
guyscu255	Well then, why?
guyscu256	Come again?
guyscu257	With guns and swords and cannons?
guyscu258	Gosh.  If it weren't for the whole 'wife being declared dead' thing,
guyscu259	I'd say that was the strangest thing I'd heard all week.
guyscu260	What makes you think that the SCUMM Bar's going to be stolen?
guyscu261	I find it difficult to believe that the SCUMM Bar is owned by somebody named 'I. Cheese.'
guyscu262	THREEPwood.
guyscu263	That's funny, I always thought the SCUMM Bar was owned by a guy named 'Ron.'
guyscu264	That sounds like a humongous fib.
guyscu265	'Paradigm?'
guyscu266	I think I tossed a bon mot in a food fight once...
guyscu267	Don't you mean 'Insult Sword Fighting?'
guyscu268	You're thinking of 'Insult Sword Fighting,' you dotty old fool!
guyscu269	Insult Arm Wrestling?
guyscu270	If I beat you at Insult Arm Wrestling, will you be my navigator?
guyscu271	Is it?  I mean, of course it is!
guyscu272	Great!
guyscu273	Agreed.
guyscu274	I was kind of hoping that you'd cave in due to my incessant nagging.
guyscu275	So?
guyscu276	I haven't got a clue.
guyscu277	That sword's in there pretty deep.  Looks like I missed a mighty bar fight.
guyscu278	I'm pretty sure I'm not the one true king.
guyscu279	It's half full.  Or, perhaps it's half empty.
guyscu280	The owner wouldn't be too happy if I took that.
guyscu281	Not even a life preserver will save what lies beyond that door.
guyscu282	I don't see anyone drowning anything other than their sorrows.
guyscu283	Someone's going to be upset when they see what their mast was used for.
guyscu284	I'm not planning on starting any fires.
guyscu285	Perfect for popcorn.
guyscu286	If her tender side is anything like the painting behind you, I don't want to see it.
guyscu287	Wow, that's pretty good.
guyscu288	Nice shot.
guyscu289	I'm impressed.
guyscu290	Hey, you're pretty good.
guyscu291	Impressive.
guyshi001	Are you guys ready to go?
guyshi002	Then we're off to Lucre Island™, in search of high adventure and a legally-binding restraining order!
guyshi003	I need a ship.
guyshi004	Check this out.
guyshi005	The Gubernatorial Seal of Mêlée Island™.
guyshi006	It's pink!
guyshi007	B...but it's pink!
guyshi008	Can I go now?
guyshi009	It's...pink.
guyshi010	Hey!  A talking figurehead!
guyshi011	Well, actually, I'm a mighty pirate captain.
guyshi012	Besides, there's no such thing as a talking monkey.
guyshi013	Um, okay, well, I'll talk to ya later.
guyshi014	A statuesque lady of your beauty should have a necklace.
guyshi015	Um, no.  It's like a pendant.  It looks good on ya.
guyshi016	Yeah, do ya mind?
guyshi017	All right, mateys!  Stay here and watch the ship while I go into town.
guyshi018	HEY!
guyshi019	Ahem.  Please stay here and guard the ship.  I'll be back soon.
guyshi020	This is your captain speaking.  Prepare the ship for departure!
guyshi021	Jambalaya Island™.  Home of the Ultimate Insult.
guyshi022	Can you get us there, Mister Cheese?
guyshi023	Make it so.
guyshi024	Now that's a fine looking ship!
guyshi025	Now that's a fine looking dinghy!
guyshi026	I can't use that dinghy...it doesn't belong to me.
guyshi027	'Sold.'
guyshi028	It says 'Ship for Sale'.
guyshi029	Watch the bottle drop!
guyshi030	I can't use this machine...I don't have any money.
guyshi031	I thought all large women were jolly.
guyshi032	She looks bored.
guyshi033	Hey, look at my cool guber-symbol.
guyshi034	That's the second most beautiful figurehead I've ever seen.
guyshi035	That's the second most temperamental figurehead I've ever met.
guyshi036	I'm not sure how I'd use this.
guyshi037	This path leads back to town.
guyshi038	Nothing interesting down here.
guyshi039	I'm Guybrush Marl... Threepwood, and I need a ship!
guyshi040	Hi.  I'm back.
guyshi041	Nice night for a sail, eh?
guyshi042	Are you the Harbor Master?
guyshi043	Which means?
guyshi044	Who's in charge around here?
guyshi045	I'm just gonna take one of these boats.
guyshi046	Baby, you can be in charge of my ships any day of the week.
guyshi047	Er, uh, no.
guyshi048	So, uh, you're in charge of the ships.
guyshi049	Kinda snooty for a glorified barnacle watcher, aren't ya?
guyshi050	I'm commandeering a vessel!
guyshi051	Say, haven't I seen you somewhere before?
guyshi052	I know!  At the SCUMM Bar!  You're the naked girl in the painting!
guyshi053	You must be some kind of ship expert to land such an important and specialized job.
guyshi054	All this red tape is giving me a headache.
guyshi055	But Stan said I could.
guyshi056	I'm married to the Governor.
guyshi057	Well, she does have her quiet moments, but she's alive and back on Mêlée, and ready to govern!
guyshi058	Come on, just give me a boat.
guyshi059	You're not helping.
guyshi060	How does that work again?
guyshi061	I can hardly wait.
guyshi062	What would it take to get you to look the other way?
guyshi063	Isn't there some sort of loophole?
guyshi064	Come on.  Just this once?  For me?
guyshi065	Never mind.
guyshi066	Who painted you?
guyshi067	You could lose your job if anyone found out that you posed for that picture.
guyshi068	Uh, I'd rather not think about it.
guyshi069	What's your name?
guyshi070	Well, I like to know the names of people I've seen naked.
guyshi071	On second thought, I'd rather not talk about you.
guyshi072	Er, nothing.
guyshi073	Have fun.
guyshi074	About this ship...
guyshi075	Why does the sign say it's been sold?
guyshi076	Couldn't you just take it down?
guyshi077	Don't ya have another one I could use?
guyshi078	Are you sure you don't you have another ship available?
guyshi079	Could you explain those regulations again?
guyshi080	Nothing, I guess.
guyshi081	Me too.
guyshi082	It's pink.
guyshi083	But it's pink.
guyshi084	Doesn't look very intimidating.
guyshi085	Darn.
guyshi086	My crew will laugh at me.
guyshi087	Never mind.  It's perfect for me.
guyshi088	Hello, there!
guyshi089	It's about the ship.
guyshi090	Don't you ever take a break?
guyshi091	How goes the election here on Mêlée?
guyshi092	Eh, never mind.  I've got important business to attend to.
guyshi093	Eh, I know what you mean.  See ya later.
guyshi094	No, no, it's fine, but it's still pink.
guyshi095	Are you?
guyshi096	Umm, nothing.
guyshi097	No, no, it's fine, but I need to keep it a while longer.
guyshi098	It's fine, except the transom shimmies in a following sea.
guyshi099	Suuuure, now she gets my name right.
guyshi100	Never mind.  It's perfect.
guyshi101	Mister Charles is really LeChuck.
guyshi102	You know, that ghastly zombie ghost pirate?
guyshi103	Umm, yeah, three times, but...
guyshi104	Why aren't you voting for Elaine Marley?
guyshi105	Is that all this election is to you, a promotion?
guyshi106	I just remembered I don't like to discuss politics with strangers.
guyshi107	Sure.  Probably better that way.
guyshi108	Hey there, Mister Cheese.
guyshi109	How are things down here?
guyshi110	Where's Carla?
guyshi111	Where?
guyshi112	What's Carla complaining about?
guyshi113	Where did Otis wander off to now?
guyshi114	Umm... There's something I need to tell you about the SCUMM Bar.
guyshi115	There's something else I need to tell you about the SCUMM Bar.
guyshi116	You shouldn't worry about losing the SCUMM Bar.
guyshi117	You've still got this navigating job to fall back on.
guyshi118	You'll never guess what I found out about that Charles L. Charles character.
guyshi119	He's actually LeChuck in disguise!
guyshi120	Aren't you surprised that Charles L. Charles is really LeChuck!?
guyshi121	Have you ever heard of something called 'The Ultimate Insult'?
guyshi122	Umm.. no...
guyshi123	What do you think of our talking figurehead?
guyshi124	I should get back to work now.
guyshi125	It's doin' fine!  Nothing to worry about.
guyshi126	Someone broke all the windows.
guyshi127	It was burned to the ground.
guyshi128	Actually, never mind.
guyshi129	It's worse.
guyshi130	It's been turned into a foofy French-Hawaiian-Japanese 'fusion' restaurant.
guyshi131	Hey, there's a quarter in here!
guyshi132	There's a quarter in there.
guyshi133	It's empty.
guyshi134	Helloooo... Anyone home?
guyshi135	I wonder where the Harbor Mistress went.
guyshi136	Otis, what are you doing in there?
guyshi137	Who's that?
guyshi138	Never mind.  I'm pretty sure I don't wanna know.
guyshi139	No, I'd rather not.
guyshi140	I sure could go for a nice, refreshing grog right now.
guyshi141	Hmm... looks like someone has been buying some grogs lately.
guyshi142	It's the evil grog machine that stole my quarter!
guyshi143	I sure showed it a thing or two.
guyshi144	Give me back my quarter!
guyshi145	I think it's had enough.
guyshi146	I need some money if I want a grog.
guyshi147	It's jammed!
guyshi148	Stupid grog machine!
guyshi149	Jackpot!
guyshi150	I've already got one.
guyshi151	Can't imagine why she'd want an empty bowl.
guyshi152	Excuse me?
guyshi153	Want a kudu jerky pretzel?
guyshi154	How can you tell?
guyshi155	Hey, she's got pierced ears.  Why would anyone put earrings on a ship's figurehead?
guyshi156	I can't attach it to her like that.
guyshi157	She won't take it.
guyshi158	My semi-competent navigator.
guyshi159	Cheese.
guyshi160	It's...pink.
guyshi161	I can see why THIS ship hasn't been sold.
guyshi162	UNGH!
guyshi163	Argh!
guyshi164	Grrrrrr!
guyshi165	Deeeeeeluxe!
guyshi166	I don't think I can just take it.
guyshi167	This one looks like a nice ride.
guyshi168	Probably a good idea to keep a couple of those near the grog machine.
guyshi169	Nobody needs saving at the moment.
guysta001	Stan?
guysta002	Is that you?
guysta003	It's Guybrush.
guysta004	Hi, Stan.
guysta005	Tell me about these pamphlets.
guysta006	I thought you were selling life insurance.
guysta007	Why?
guysta008	Why is your desk outside?
guysta009	Why are you REALLY outside?
guysta010	You're hawking real estate now?
guysta011	Tell me more about this time-share deal.
guysta012	Ever heard of something called the Ultimate Insult?
guysta013	Yes!  Do you know where I can get it?
guysta014	Never mind.
guysta015	Are you working for Ozzie Mandrill?
guysta016	He wouldn't hire ya?
guysta017	My mistake.  See ya later.
guysta018	Gimme the pitch!
guysta019	Oh.  Never mind, then.
guysta020	Eep.
guysta021	Ooh... stop right there, I'm not interested.
guysta022	Ewww...
guysta023	Uh, gosh, that sounds interesting, but I need to check with my wife first.
guysta024	Right.  I mean, where would the piranha poodles sleep?
guysta026	Zzzz... huh, huh?  Oh...
guysta027	Oh, sorry...
guysta028	Holy monkey!  It's Stan!  What's he doing here?!
guysta029	Stan's new building sure is festive looking.
guysta030	The door seems to be locked.
guysta031	Now THAT'S a beautiful beach.
guysta032	How could that possibly be an improvement?
guysta033	Not really.
guysta034	It's a temporarily beautiful beach.
guysta035	I have no time to dilly dally around at the beach.
guysta036	It says 'Stan's Time Share Emporium'.
guysta037	Stan's desk is outside.  That can't be good for the finish.
guysta038	I'd hate to have to work at a desk.
guysta039	... unless the dental plan is really good.
guysta040	It's a pretty standard desk drawer.
guysta041	There's just some fuzzy lint balls in here.
guysta042	Just a bunch of paper in here.
guysta043	Oh yuck.  Stan is keeping an extra pair of underwear in here!
guysta044	No.  And I'm pretty sure I don't want to know.
guysta045	Marketing materials for time shares.
guysta046	I think one is enough.
guysta047	That goes back to the island.
guysta048	It's the door to Stan's Time Share Emporium.
guysta049	Uh.  Okay.
guysta050	That goes down to the beach.
guystb001	Pardon me.
guystb002	You don't look like any pirate that I've ever seen.
guystb003	What's a dental hygienist doing in the Caribbean?
guystb004	Isn't it a little dangerous to be vacationing in pirate-infested waters?
guystb005	Have you seen any 'unrehabilitated' pirates?
guystb006	Yeah...great.
guystb007	What would you say if I told you that I was an 'unrehabilitated' pirate?
guystb008	What?!
guystb009	Aww, no!
guystb010	Baby, that outfit is making me hungry.
guystb011	Uh, sorry.
guystb012	Do you know where I can find the pieces of the Ultimate Insult?
guystb013	No, it's a malevolent voodoo talisman of gut-wrenching power!
guystb014	I'm trying to stop an undead evil pirate from assembling it.
guystb015	Do you wanna help me some more with the Ultimate Insult?
guystb016	What are you doing?
guystb017	Of course you can.  There are thousands of StarBuccaneers™!
guystb018	I still say that coffee is coffee is coffee.
guystb019	I see you bought one of those great StarBuccaneer's™ coffee mugs.
guystb020	Can I have it?
guystb021	Please may I have that coffee mug?
guystb022	I'll just be on my way.
guystb023	One of the pieces looks like a golden man.
guystb024	Really?
guystb025	So, you think the golden man might be the diving trophy?
guystb026	One of the pieces looks like a bronze pirate hat.
guystb027	One of the pieces looks like a silver monkey head.
guystb028	I've had just about enough talking about the Ultimate Insult for now.
guystb029	Why are all these coffee house clerks always prepubescent street urchins?
guystb030	That sounds exciting.
guystb031	I could, but I'm no bully.
guystb032	Two of my favorite smells: coffee and booty.
guystb033	I don't think I should rob this place.
guystb034	It's a ship riding a wave out of a big coffee cup.
guystb035	How cute... in a corporate retail sort of way.
guystb036	That would look great in the backyard, but I don't think Elaine would agree.
guystb037	I think it's pretty much performing its duty without any help from me.
guystb038	StarBuccaneer's™ logo merchandise.
guystb039	Logo mugs, t-shirts, thermoses, coffee pitchers...
guystb040	... and a few items that I don't recognize.
guystb041	Hey, this StarBuccaneer's™ logo mug looks like it's about the same shape and size as the Silver Monkey Mug.
guystb042	I bet they're made by the same company.
guystb043	What a rip-off.  I could get any of these things for a tenth of the price back on Mêlée Island™!
guystb044	Nah, I don't really want any of this junk.
guystb045	A small bucket of StarBuccaneer's™ logo umbrellas.
guystb046	I sure don't want a trendy, overpriced StarBuccaneer's™ umbrella.
guystb047	I've never even seen it RAIN in the Tri-Island Area!
guystb048	No, it's bad luck to open an umbrella unless it's raining.
guystb049	Wow, seems a little gaudy to have a sign that big INSIDE the store.
guystb050	I'm pretty sure they'd notice if I took that.
guystb051	It's somebody's cup of coffee.
guystb052	I don't work here.
guystb053	Gross.
guystb054	It's a cup of coffee.
guystb055	I'm not paid to clean up after the customers.
guystb056	Smells like a Crapaccino.
guystb057	No thanks.
guystb058	A cup of black bubbling bitterness.
guystb059	It isn't nice to drink someone else's coffee.
guystb060	A copiously creamified cup o' coffee.
guystb061	How much can you like coffee if you put that much cream in it?
guystb062	I prefer my coffee with less cream.
guystb063	The owner of this cup should try some coffee with their sugar.  Ugh.
guystb064	Naw, I'm too tough and piratey to drink coffee this sweet.
guystb065	It's the machine that dispenses all the StarBuccaneer's™ fancy coffee drinks.
guystb066	As much as I'd like to have one of my own, it looks a bit heavy to carry with me.
guystb067	I don't think this is a self-serve establishment.
guystb068	That's a big pile o' cups.
guystb069	Unlike the cups in the good ol' SCUMM Bar, these cups appear to be CLEAN.
guystb070	What's the world coming to?!
guystb071	I can't reach them.
guystb072	Touristy stuff, mostly.
guystb073	Lots of coffee and a StarBuccaneer's™ logo coffee cup.
guystb074	There's a sale on coffee beans!
guystb075	Oops.  My mistake.
guystb076	That goes outside to town.
guystb077	Grog me!
guystb078	I'd like a coffee drink.
guystb079	I'm a mighty pirate.  Surrender your women!
guystb080	I doubt it.  Bye.
guystb081	But I wanna grog!
guystb082	Grog-flavored?
guystb083	Give me your best grog-flavored drink.
guystb084	Do you have anything other than coffee?
guystb085	Eh, on second thought, skip it.
guystb086	I'll have your coffee of the day.
guystb087	I'll have whatever tastes the most grog-like.
guystb088	What are the hip pirates drinking?
guystb089	I'm rethinking this whole coffee idea.
guystb090	I'll have one of those, then.
guystb091	Still offering that free refill?
guystb092	But I don't have 350 Jambalaya Bucks.
guystb093	I'll come back when I have something figured out.
guystb094	But doesn't your company prey on the competitors?
guystb095	Did your PR person make you say that?
guystb096	You must be very proud.
guystb097	But that's not very convenient for me, the consumer.
guystb098	Gee, that sounds great... hey!  Wait a minute!  I don't like that.  I'm taking my business elsewhere.
guystb099	Uh, that's nice.
guystb100	But I AM a real pirate.
guystb101	Yikes!
guystb102	Pirates don't drink coffee.
guystb103	Not the pirates I've met.
guystb104	Umm, sure.
guystb105	Never mind.
guystb106	I'd like a refill please.
guystb107	That's a souvenir mug, not a coffee cup.
guystb108	Uuuhhh...
guystb109	Just get me my groggoccino, please?
guystb110	So it is.
guystb111	There's something very peculiar about this lady...
guystb112	No thanks.  Definitely not my type.
guystb113	Besides, my horoscope this morning said 'Beware of new interests, blunder beckons in the horizon'.
guystb114	Whatever that means.
guystb115	Um.  Great.
guystb116	It's a tray full of mini-bagels with some kind of weird pasty goop on top.
guystb117	They're mini-bagels with Schmear Whiz™ on them.
guystb118	I've already got one.
guystb119	Eww, no!  The last one I tried was REALLY gross!
guystb120	You don't happen to offer free refills, do you?
guystb121	I don't think I should put it back since I already touched it.
guystb122	Those bagels already look like they have vomit on them.
guystb123	I think she'll notice if I try to take the whole bag.
guystb124	I already feel bad enough about taking it from her.  There's no need to taunt her with it!
guytoc001	Herman!
guytoc002	Here!  You're Herman Toothrot, the hermit of Monkey Island™!
guytoc003	Herman?
guytoc004	Your memory seems to be slipping.
guytoc005	Is your memory getting any better?
guytoc006	How're things on Monkey Island™?
guytoc007	I need some help.
guytoc008	I could still use some help.
guytoc009	See ya later, Herman.
guytoc010	What DO you remember?
guytoc011	Eh, it's nice to see that whatever's scrambled your brain hasn't affected your sense of humor...at all.
guytoc012	Think hard.  Do you remember anything else?
guytoc013	What's the earliest thing you remember?
guytoc014	Eh, I don't think so.
guytoc015	Just try to remember as far back as you can.
guytoc016	What?
guytoc017	When?
guytoc018	You can't remember back more than a couple of hours?
guytoc019	So, your memory still doesn't reach back more than a couple of hours?
guytoc020	I think I'll plumb the murky depths of your memory later.
guytoc021	Do you remember where you parked your ship?
guytoc022	I really, REALLY need to get back to Mêlée Island™.
guytoc023	Well, yeah, but--
guytoc024	But--
guytoc025	So, you really don't know where your ship is?
guytoc026	You probably don't know how to counteract an Ultimate Insult, do you?
guytoc027	It's a big, evil voodoo thingamajig.
guytoc028	You don't know any secret ways to defeat Ozzie Mandrill and LeChuck, do you?
guytoc029	That's what I thought.
guytoc030	This isn't helping.  Let's talk about something else.
guytoc031	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate.
guytoc032	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, your best friend in the whole world.
guytoc033	Ummm.
guytoc034	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, man, I took a bullet for you in 'Nam.
guytoc035	Herman!  You got your memory back!
guytoc036	This is gonna be harder than I thought.
guytoc037	How's your memory?
guytoc038	I'd like to hear some more about what's going on on Monkey Island™.
guytoc039	Do you remember anything else?
guytoc040	A milk bottle?
guytoc041	Explosions?
guytoc042	When did all this happen?
guytoc043	So, you can only remember the last few months?
guytoc044	Do you remember where you docked your ship?
guytoc045	Do you have even the slightest idea where you might have left your ship?
guytoc046	It's a nasty voodoo McGuffin from Heck.
guytoc047	Is the Ultimate Insult ringing any bells yet?
guytoc048	You haven't stumbled across any ways to defeat Ozzie and LeChuck, have you?
guytoc049	I was afraid of that.
guytoc050	Have you remembered any ways to defeat Ozzie and LeChuck?
guytoc051	Guess not.
guytoc052	On second thought, I don't think you'll be too helpful in this state.
guytoc053	Where are all the monkeys?
guytoc054	What do you think of Jojo Jr., the talking monkey?
guytoc055	What have you been doing with yourself?
guytoc056	Yes, yes I would.
guytoc057	How's the mining going?
guytoc058	Why?
guytoc059	There's a big, metal wall under Monkey Island™?
guytoc060	About this impenetrable barrier under Monkey Island™...
guytoc061	Do you know there's a crazy ghost building a church on the volcano?
guytoc062	Herman, that joke's older than you look.
guytoc063	About the ghost priest...
guytoc064	So, you think the ghost priest is harmless?
guytoc065	Let's not talk about Monkey Island™ right now.
guytoc066	Toys?
guytoc067	Why does a hermit need gold?
guytoc068	A creamy, nougat center?
guytoc069	The REAL Secret to Monkey Island™?
guytoc070	The Script to Episode II?
guytoc071	Herman!  You remember me?
guytoc072	You've gotten all your memory back?
guytoc073	Are you sure your memory's whole?
guytoc074	Do you remember the cannibals?
guytoc075	Do you remember LeChuck's amusement park?
guytoc076	I kinda wondered about that myself.
guytoc077	Do you remember Dinky Island™?
guytoc078	LeChuck told me there was a tunnel between Dinky and Monkey Island™.
guytoc079	Do you remember the caverns to Heck under the Giant Monkey Head?
guytoc080	Try.
guytoc081	An accordion?
guytoc082	So, you really don't remember anything about your life before you washed up on Monkey Island™?
guytoc083	Let's pore over your mental state later.
guytoc084	NOW do you know where your ship is?
guytoc085	Great!
guytoc086	That's...just...great.
guytoc087	Now I'll have to find some OTHER way off this heckhole of a lush, tropical island paradise.
guytoc088	You wouldn't happen to know any OTHER ways off of Monkey Island™, would you?
guytoc089	Oy.
guytoc090	Do you know how to fight an Ultimate Insult?
guytoc091	It's a voodoo talisman with the power to crush men's souls!
guytoc092	Do you know any secret hermit tricks to defeat LeChuck and Ozzie Mandrill?
guytoc093	LeChuck?
guytoc094	Ozzie Mandrill?  You know Ozzie Mandrill?
guytoc095	Are you sure you can't help me beat Ozzie and LeChuck?
guytoc096	On second thought, maybe I'll ask for your help later.
guytoc097	Her--, I mean, Governor Marley?
guytoc098	Horatio?
guytoc099	How does it feel to have your memory back?
guytoc100	Ummm, cautiously optimistic?
guytoc101	How am I supposed to defeat the Ultimate Insult?
guytoc102	Wellll, let's just suppose that something goes wrong.  How would I stop an Ultimate Insult talisman?
guytoc103	But what?
guytoc104	How hard could that be?
guytoc105	How ancient?
guytoc106	The language of the Ultimate Insult is monkey jabber?
guytoc107	Eh, it's a good thing we're on Monkey Island™, then.
guytoc108	I'm a little unclear on this 'counteracting the Ultimate Insult' thing.
guytoc109	How am I supposed to get off this #&$*@'n island?
guytoc110	See ya later, Governor.
guytoc111	Grandpa?
guytoc112	That's no way to talk, sir.  We're gonna have to work together to defeat Ozzie and LeChuck.
guytoc113	Did I say LeChuck?  I meant to say 'Ozzie and his duck.'
guytoc114	If by 'involved' you mean 'working hand-in-hand with Ozzie to destroy the pirate lifestyle as we know it,' then, yeah.
guytoc115	Actually, he's the new governor of Mêlée Island™.
guytoc116	The Secret of Monkey Island™?
guytoc117	The REAL Secret of Monkey Island™?
guytoc118	The Secret of your Missing Pants?
guytoc119	The Secret to Milking a Questionably Popular Video Game Franchise?
guytoc120	The one that had to do with the Governorship of Mêlée Island™?  I was wondering about that.  What is it?
guytoc121	Maybe we should come up with a backup plan.
guytoc122	Who woulda thought that Herman Toothrot is really Grandpa Marley?
guytoc123	It's old Herman Toothrot, the hermit of Monkey Island™.
guytoc124	Nah, I already bonked him with this coconut.
guytoc125	Nah, I already smacked him upside the head with this here milk bottle.
guytoc126	Nah, I already wonked him with this accordion.
guytoc127	Ah yes, the magic of a warm campfire.
guytoc128	... It's probably more charming at night.
guytoc129	It's a warm day.  I don't need the added heat of a blazing campfire.
guytoc130	This is a prime sitting log.
guytoc131	I don't have time to lounge around on the beach.
guytoc132	How quaint.
guytoc133	It's impolite to use someone else's home without asking.
guytoc134	They're just hangin' out.
guytoc135	Eugh.  After the LUA Bar kitchen and Lucre Town Bait Shoppe, I don't think I wanna touch another fish again for quite a while.
guytoc136	Wonder where this gigantic wheel came from.
guytoc137	Boats don't generally have big wheels...
guytoc138	It looks like this little shack was built on the bow of an old, mangled ship.
guytoc139	This path leads to the rest of Monkey Island™.
guytoc140	I don't think bonking Herman with his banana picker is a good idea.
guytoc141	Let him pick his own bananas.
guytow001	You just made that up, didn't you?
guytow002	Ah, I see.  He plans to build really ugly towers all over the Caribbean,
guytow003	driving down property values to the point where he can scoop up all the land for a fraction of its real value!
guytow004	How ingenious!
guytow005	Are you sure it's not the property values thing?
guytow006	Somehow I knew you were gonna say that...
guytow007	I don't think that's a good idea.
guytow008	Now that's a tower!
guytow009	There's no way to get up to the top of that tower from down here.
guytow010	That's the second largest... no, no, that IS the largest conch shell I've ever seen.
guytow011	There must be some way to take this out of commission.
guytow012	I can't reach it from here.
guytow013	This thing is permanently attached to the top of this tower!
guytow014	I guess I'm going to have to find another way to disable this thing.
guytow015	There's a very large switch sticking out of this shell.
guytow016	Where did they find a tree big enough to make a plank this big?!
guytow017	That is the shortest of the very very very tall towers.
guytow018	There's nothing up there that this robot would be able to stand on.
guytow019	I'm already standing on it.
guytow020	That strikes me as being counterproductive.
guytow021	For a medium-sized tower it's pretty huge.
guytow022	That's too high up for even this giant monkey bot to reach from here.
guytow023	There doesn't appear to be a way for the robot to climb this tower.
guytow024	I think it would be more useful if I leave it where it is.
guytow025	I can't use it from down here.
guytri001	Mister Cheese, shouldn't we steer away from those dark, portentous clouds?
guytri002	Mommeeeeeeee!
guytri003	Sorry, baby.
guytri004	Not in the face!  Not in the face!
guytri005	There's no place like home, there's no place like home...
guytri006	Mister Cheese, wouldn't it be easier to sail AROUND that typhoon on the horizon?
guyuch001	It's a skull.
guyuch002	I've already got a skull.
guyuch003	Murray?
guyuch004	Guess not.
guyuch005	Wow.  I wonder if Elaine will let me have one of these.
guyuch006	Nah, I wouldn't want to get tipsy in here and accidentally break something expensive.
guyuch007	Ick.  Dirty dishes.  For a master thief, Pegnose is a real slob.
guyuch008	I've got plenty of tables at home.
guyuch009	What an odd collection of junk.  There doesn't actually seem to be all that much valuable stuff in here.
guyuch010	No, I'd probably get busted for possession of stolen property.
guyuch011	What kind of twisted freak keeps the skulls of his victims lying in piles around his showroom?
guyuch012	I bet he wasn't hugged much as a child.
guyuch013	Ewww!  No way!  Who knows where these skulls have been?
guyuch014	Other than inside somebody's head, I mean.
guyuch015	The bank booty and the Marley Heirlooms are in the cavern on the other side of this unbreakable window.
guyuch016	Yeah, sure, I'll just break that reinforced glass by banging my head on it.
guyuch017	That'll certainly mess up the carpet.
guyuch018	I wonder what's behind this drape-like thing that's occluding my view...
guyuch019	I don't think I'm qualified to redecorate this room.
guyuch020	I can't reach the drape hook.
guyuch021	Hm.  I guess I need to pull that ring somehow to open these drapes.
guyuch022	I can't reach it with just my arm though.
guyuch023	I can't reach it.
guyuch024	Hey!  That looks like the Lucre Town Bank's missing loot!  And the Marley Heirlooms!
guyuch025	I've got to find a way to get in there!
guyuch026	It's a ladder.  It goes up.
guyuch027	I put a ladder in my pants once...I'm not eager to repeat the experience.
guyuch028	This button practically screams 'Push Me.'
guyuch029	I already opened the drapes.
guyulg001	I'm almost out of air.
guyulg002	I better get to the surface.
guyulg003	I can't tell what that is.
guyulg004	It's... something.
guyulg005	I have no idea what that is.
guyulg006	It's too dark to see.
guyulg007	Hmmm...
guyulg008	I'm not picking up anything unless I know what it is first.
guyulg009	I don't think I should do that.
guyulg010	No
guyulg011	It's just a rock.
guyulg012	I really don't want a rock.
guyulg013	I believe this species is known as 'Echinasteridae Henricia'.
guyulg014	It's probably attached to that rock real tight.
guyulg015	Looks like someone couldn't hold their breath long enough.
guyulg016	Out of respect, I think I'll leave it alone.
guyulg017	I think that's called 'Moose Coral'.
guyulg018	No, coral is too important and fragile to tamper with.
guyulg019	Hey, there's a secret-looking door there!
guyulg020	It's a door.
guyulg021	I wonder where that rope goes?
guyulg022	It's just some slimy sea weed.
guyulg023	It's the way up to the surface.
guyulg024	Wish those fish would come over here so I could see something.
guyulg025	It's a school of little, glowing fish.
guyulg026	I don't think I'll be able to catch them with my bare hands.
guyulg027	Hmm.  Maybe I should wait until they're closer.
guyulg028	It's a cavern leading into the rocks.
guyulg029	Hey, he stole my bait!
guyunc001	Hey, something just fell out of the chest!
guyunc002	That's Pegnose's showroom over there.
guyunc003	That window is completely unbreakable.
guyunc004	What a strangely shaped stalactite.
guyunc005	I'd better not.
guyunc006	It's beautiful!
guyunc007	It's don't think it's my time to walk into the light.
guyunc008	I can't reach it.
guyunc009	I mean, I REALLY can't reach it.
guyunc010	That's the way out of this damp, depressing, cave.
guyunc011	Whew!  It's a good thing I can hold my breath for ten minutes!
guyvau001	There seems to be something inside.
guyvau002	It's a music box!
guyvau003	It's an empty safe.
guyvau004	It's a small pile of packing sponge.
guyvau005	It's a small pile of packing sponges.
guyvau006	It used to be the door that kept unauthorized visitors from walking in and out of here.
guyvau007	It's the door to freedom.
guyvau008	And it's starting to give.
guyvau009	It's already open.
guyvau010	If I could open it, I wouldn't be trapped in here.
guyvau011	It isn't in very good condition.
guyvau012	That hinge looks like it could break at any minute.
guyvau013	It's the only thing holding this door in place.
guyvau014	It's one of the hinges that holds this door in place.
guyvau015	Arrgh... ungh!
guyvau016	I broke the hinge off!
guyvau017	But I broke the sword, too.
guyvau018	Uh, I can't remove it with my bare hands.
guyvau019	The sponges have expanded the crack a little.
guyvau020	There are dry sponges stuffed in the door jamb.
guyvau021	With the sword jammed in there, the gap is larger.
guyvau022	There's a little space between the door and the frame.
guyvau023	The sword seems to be widening the crack a bit.
guyvau024	Uh, the crack is too small.
guyvau025	MINUTES LATER...
guyvau026	That crack is filled to the gills with sponges now.
guyvau027	There's a single sponge stuffed into the crack.
guyvau028	Hm, I guess this grog is too mellow to eat through the door.
guyvau029	I'm free!
guyvau030	I think I'm getting close.  The door looks ready to pop.
guyvau031	Eh, I don't want to stick my hand in the crack any more than I have to.
guyvau032	I could reach way up high from on top of that.
guyvau033	That looks fun, but not very useful.
guyvau034	Why do all bank chairs look so uncomfortable?
guyvau035	That'd be a bigger waste of time than playing video games.
guyvau036	I guess this grog is too mellow to eat through this hinge.
guyvau037	I better take this broken sword with me in case I need it again later...
guyvoo001	That was neat!  A rotating chair!
guyvoo002	I need one of those at home...
guyvoo003	What a strange mirror.
guyvoo004	Hm.  It appears to be attached to the wall.
guyvoo005	Hmm... this table must've been a hand-me-down.
guyvoo006	There are only a few hands I want in my pants, and this isn't one of them.
guyvoo007	This finger seems slightly different than the others.
guyvoo008	As useful as a big finger would be while sailing in heavy traffic, I don't think I need it.
guyvoo009	Yikes!
guyvoo010	Nothing happened.
guyvoo011	I don't think this smoke holder holds much smoke.
guyvoo012	I just say no to smoking.
guyvoo013	It's an ancient voodoo sword!
guyvoo014	I don't need another sword.
guyvoo015	The smell of this basket brings back horrible memories of Puerto Pollo.
guyvoo016	No way!  I've had more than my share of chicken feathers!
guyvoo017	Yup, that's a ladder.
guyvoo018	That ladder will never fit in my pants.
guyvoo019	I'm not climbing that ladder.
guyvoo020	Who knows what kind of scary stuff is up there!
guyvoo021	Perhaps I've become desensitized, but this pile of human bones no longer sickens me as it once did.
guyvoo022	I'm not carting around anyone's mortal remains unless it's absolutely necessary.
guyvoo023	Wow, a 4Dfx VoodooMask6!  Cutting edge voodoo technology!
guyvoo024	No way.  Installing the drivers on these things always gives me a headache.
guyvoo025	Ouch!  I'd hate to be that guy.
guyvoo026	No, I'm not into torturing complete strangers.
guyvoo027	Present company excepted, of course.
guyvoo028	'Cream of Frog.'
guyvoo029	Ehhh... no thanks.  I'll pass.
guyvoo030	'Essence of Worm-Ridden Seagull.'
guyvoo031	Ugh... that's really, really disgusting.
guyvoo032	'Monkey Armpit Juice.'
guyvoo033	'Sea Slug Pâté'
guyvoo034	That leads outside.
guyvoo035	Hey, it's you!
guyvoo036	You seem to show up whenever I'm in trouble.
guyvoo037	Why?
guyvoo038	What do you know about this Ultimate Insult doohickey that everyone's talking about?
guyvoo039	Yeah.
guyvoo040	I'd like to go over this Ultimate Insult thingamambob again.
guyvoo041	What do these Marley Heirlooms have to do with the Ultimate Insult?
guyvoo042	Stop doing that!
guyvoo043	But you're right... This chest contains Grandpa Marley's heirlooms.
guyvoo044	According to Grandpa Marley's letter, his wedding presents to Elaine hold the key to assembling the Ultimate Insult.
guyvoo045	But there's so much stuff in these heirlooms that it's hard to separate the presents from the junk.
guyvoo046	Hey, a pair of earrings!
guyvoo047	Ooh, a necklace!
guyvoo048	A pen on a chain?  What kind of a present is that?
guyvoo049	Is something wrong?
guyvoo050	Maybe it's still on Lucre Island™.
guyvoo051	Do you have any idea where I can find the BLUE wedding present?
guyvoo052	What am I supposed to do with the wedding presents?
guyvoo053	But how?
guyvoo054	I don't know what to do next.
guyvoo055	I'm still slightly clueless.
guyvoo056	Do you have any nifty voodoo googams that could help me?
guyvoo057	I'm still in the market for a voodoo-drenched Deus Ex Machina that'll save the proverbial day.
guyvoo058	I thought we'd chat for a while.  Catch up on old times.
guyvoo059	I'd like to gossip a little more.
guyvoo060	Didn't you relocate to the island of Puerto Pollo?
guyvoo061	Did you really move your thriving voodoo emporium back to Mêlée Island™ just to be near me?
guyvoo062	Who's this Charles L. Charles guy, and where does he get off trying to take my wife's job?
guyvoo063	What politician doesn't?
guyvoo064	Do you know anything else about Charles L. Charles?
guyvoo065	Why didn't you tell me that Charles L. Charles is really LeChuck!?
guyvoo066	Why is Mêlée Island™ so empty?
guyvoo067	I thought so.
guyvoo068	Well?
guyvoo069	Why is Mêlée Island™ so empty!?
guyvoo070	How awful.  Why don't the pirates just refuse to play?
guyvoo071	Good point.
guyvoo072	Do you know anything more about the mysterious foreign investor?
guyvoo073	'Sydney'?  That sounds like the name of a kid who gets beat up a lot in school.
guyvoo074	You've helped me so much over the years, and I still don't know your name.
guyvoo075	Aw, c'mon, what's your name?
guyvoo076	I'd like to talk about more important matters.
guyvoo077	How do I stop that weasel from hurling rocks at my house?
guyvoo078	Yeah, like on my house!
guyvoo079	I'm still not sure how to stop my house from getting destroyed.
guyvoo080	How do I get to Lucre Island™?
guyvoo081	But I don't have a ship!
guyvoo082	A crew?  Where am I gonna get a crew?
guyvoo083	But I don't know where to find Lucre Island™.
guyvoo084	Tell me again how to get to Lucre Island™.
guyvoo085	How can I help Elaine win her re-election?
guyvoo086	Absolutely nothing.
guyvoo087	Great!  Better get a'stuffin!
guyvoo088	Uuh... I don't think I like that idea.
guyvoo089	Are you sure there's no way I can help Elaine get re-elected?
guyvoo090	But what's my path?
guyvoo091	I kind of figured it would be.
guyvoo092	I've got to know how to stop Ozzie and LeChuck!
guyvoo093	I'm still a little unclear on this 'stopping the bad guys' thing.
guyvoo094	Actually, I think I can figure out what to do next all by myself.
guyvoo095	Good guess.
guyvoo096	That's not what I--
guyvoo097	More coveted and dangerous than the indescribable terrors of Big Whoop?
guyvoo098	Yowee.  What does it do?
guyvoo099	Insults?  That's all?  I thought it would be potion that turned people inside out or something...
guyvoo100	Wow...
guyvoo101	Uh, wait a minute...If the insults are in a forgotten language, how come they're so dangerous?  Wouldn't that have the same affect as insulting me in Finnish?
guyvoo102	Whoa.
guyvoo103	That WOULD be useful.
guyvoo104	No, I--
guyvoo105	That's strange...you've always seemed to be the master of all things voodoo-like.
guyvoo106	That's awful!
guyvoo107	It would be good to know where to start.
guyvoo108	Um, not really--
guyvoo109	Monkey Island™?
guyvoo110	What is the Ultimate Insult?
guyvoo111	Tell me again about the nature of the Ultimate Insult.
guyvoo112	Oh yeah.  That's what I thought you said.
guyvoo113	How do I make an Ultimate Insult?
guyvoo114	Tell me again about how to build an Ultimate Insult.
guyvoo115	That's right.  I forgot.
guyvoo116	Where can I find the Ultimate Insult?
guyvoo117	Tell me again about where I can find the makings of an Ultimate Insult.
guyvoo118	An island.  Check.
guyvoo119	On second thought, I don't want to talk about the Ultimate Insult right now.
guyvoo120	Have you got any of those evil-destroying voodoo dolls?
guyvoo121	How about one of those invisibility necklaces to help me sneak into womens' locker rooms?
guyvoo122	Yeah.  Got any?
guyvoo123	Do you have any +10 strength elixirs in stock?
guyvoo124	I don't think I've got any.
guyvoo125	I see your point.
guyvoo126	I could really use a potion that would make me immune to severe gas attacks.
guyvoo127	I'm in the market for an enchanted sword that hypnotizes my enemies into a deep stupor before I skewer them with it.
guyvoo128	Gee, thanks.
guyvoo129	Have you got any snacks?  I'm starving.
guyvoo130	On second thought, I probably shouldn't be shopping at a time like this.
guyvoo131	I don't need any more of your enigmatic hoodoo right now.
guyvoo132	That's quite a thumb.
guyvoo133	As useful as a big thumb would be when hitching for rides, I don't think I need it.
guyvoo134	For a pinky finger, it's quite large.
guyvoo135	I've already got a pinky finger.
guyvoo136	If that's a ring finger, I'd hate to see the size of the ring.
guyvoo137	I don't need another ring finger.
guyvoo138	Ah, the middle finger...the most communicative of fingers.
guyvoo139	Nothing interesting up here.
guyvoo140	If I want to point at something, I'll use my OWN index finger.
guyvoo141	Beady.
guyvoo142	I don't think they're for sale.
guywed001	Yikes!  Too hot!
guywed002	That cannon looks ready to fire.
guywed003	If only I could get that thing to go off!
guywed004	Even if I wasn't tied to a mast, I doubt I could pick up that cannon.
guywed005	It's way out of reach.
guywed006	I managed to knock it over.  There's a pile of red hot coals sitting on the deck now.
guywed007	Now I'm glad we got the ship with the flame-retardant lacquered deck wood.
guywed008	It's full of hot coals.
guywed009	It's too cumbersome to handle with just my feet.
guywed010	I already knocked it over.
guywed011	There's a pile of red hot coals simmering on the deck there.
guywed012	Now I'm glad we got the ship with the flame-retardant lacquered deck wood.
guywed013	I don't think I can safely handle more than one at a time.
guywed014	I should try to pick one up if I wanna try to do something with it.
guywed015	I don't think anybody reloaded that cannon.
guywed016	That didn't do anything.  I suppose that's probably because it's not loaded.
guywed017	It's the grated door to the ship's cargo hold.
guywed018	I have more important things to do than futz around in the cargo hold.
guywed019	I hope there was nothing flammable in the hold.
guywed020	I REALLY hope it didn't burn any holes in Elaine's suede luggage... I'd never hear the end of it!
guywed021	Their ship is bigger than ours.  Those bullies!
guywed022	Come here often?
guywed023	What's your sign?
guywed024	Can I buy you a grog?
guywed025	I might if I wasn't tied to the mast.
guywed026	I guess a hot coal just doesn't have as much oomph as a cannonball out of a cannon.
guywed027	There's an enemy pirate fighting over there.
guywed028	Um.  Excuse me.  I don't suppose you'd mind just leaving us alone?  I'll give you all my milk money...
guywed029	Um.  Excuse me?
guywed030	I guess he doesn't want to talk to me.
guywed031	Nope.  He might not miss next time.
guywed032	Better not try that again.
h1ch027	Mwah-hah-haaaa!
h1ch030	Now now, my dear Mrs. Marley-
h1ch032	-is that any way to talk to the next Governor of Mêlée Island™?
h1ch034	Mwah-hah-haaaa!  The pirates of Mêlée couldn't see through a window!  They can't even see what's right in front of them!
h1ch034a	Mwah-hah-haaaa!  The pirates of Mêlée couldn't see through a window!
h1ch034b	They can't even see what's right in front of them!
h1ch036	Why, only the biggest lie...
h1ch037	...of...
h1ch038	...Them...
h1ch039	 ...ALL!
h1el001	This can't be right.
h1el003	But-
h1el005	Guybrush!  Ah! You're back!
h1el008	Oh, Guybrush, this is wonderful!  Estaban, take these papers down to the Mêlée Town Hall, and save my mansion!
h1el008a	Oh, Guybrush, this is wonderful!
h1el008b	Estaban, take these papers down to the Mêlée Town Hall, and save my mansion!
h1el009	Oh, Guybrush, I am so glad you're back!  What took you so long?
h1el014	(Yawning) That was, um, (yawn) thrilling, dear. Now, let me see if I've got this straight: An evil Australian tycoon named Ozzie Mandrill is buying up all the land in the Caribbean...
h1el016	...but he hates pirates, and wants to get rid of them...
h1el018	...so he's looking for the secret to something called the Ultimate Insult...
h1el020	...which he thinks can be found in that sack of junk you've retrieved from my dead grandfather's safe deposit chest...
h1el022	...so he hired Pegnose Pete to steal my grandfather's booty, and frame you for the crime.
h1el024	Well, seems like the sensible thing to do would be to destroy my grandfather's heirlooms, so that no one could get their hands on the Ultimate Insult, whatever that is.
h1el024a	Well, seems like the sensible thing to do would be to
h1el024b	destroy my grandfather's heirlooms,
h1el024c	so that no one could get their hands on the Ultimate Insult, whatever that is.
h1el029	Charles, you manipulating weasel, get out of my house before I sic my piranha poodles on you!
h1el029a	Charles, you manipulating weasel,
h1el029b	get out of my house before I sic my piranha poodles on you!
h1el033	I don't care what the polls say, the pirates of Mêlée will see through your tissues of false hopes and empty promises!
h1el033a	I don't care what the polls say,
h1el033b	the pirates of Mêlée will see through your tissues
h1el033c	of false hopes and empty promises!
h1el040	LeChuck!
h1el044	Ha! How do you expect to be elected once I tell everyone that you're really LeChuck?
h1el044a	Ha! How do you expect to be elected
h1el044b	once I tell everyone that you're really LeChuck?
h1es002	I'm afraid it is, Governor.  Charles L. Charles's 'Good Times/Free Grog' campaign has given him a 23% lead in all the polls.
h1es002a	I'm afraid it is, Governor.
h1es002b	Charles L. Charles's 'Good Times/Free Grog' campaign
h1es002c	has given him a 23% lead in all the polls.
h1gb004	Honey, I'm home!
h1gb006	Yes, and look what I've got!
h1gb007	Eh. Oh, wait, that's not it...
h1gb010	Well, that's a funny story.  It all started when I went looking for the no-nosed pirate...
h1gb010a	Well, that's a funny story.
h1gb010b	It all started when I went looking for the no-nosed pirate...
h1gb011	...and then Ozzie said 'I'm gonna put your shrimp on me barbie'...
h1gb012	...after that I was attacked by an army of koalas!
h1gb013	...and so, the lawyers used the Marley Mansion deed to draw up the legal papers to save the mansion, and I came back here.
h1gb013a	...and so, the lawyers used the Marley Mansion deed to draw up the
h1gb013b	legal papers to save the mansion, and I came back here.
h1gb015	Right.
h1gb017	Right.
h1gb019	Check.
h1gb021	Yup.
h1gb023	That's it.
h1gb025	I agree. Got a match?
h1gb026	Gee these LucasArts™ adventure games are getting shorter and shorter...Aha!
h1gb028	Yipes!
h1gb031	Threepwood
h1gb035	What are you talking about?
h1gb041	LeChuck!
h1gb046	Huh?
h1gb048	Oh yeah?  Well, you fight like a cow!
h1lc042	At your service.
h1lc043	Enough of this inane banter!  I've got an election to win!
h1lc045	Go ahead, tell them.  Shout it from the rooftops.  It will only ensure my victory.  And once I'm elected, I'll use my gubernatorial powers to divine the secrets of the Ultimate Insult--
h1lc045a	Go ahead, tell them.  Shout it from the rooftops.
h1lc045b	It will only ensure my victory.  And once I'm elected,
h1lc045c	I'll use my gubernatorial powers to divine the secrets of the Ultimate Insult--
h1lc047	You heard me, the Ultimate Insult!  With its unholy power, I'll make the seas run red with the blood of my enemies!  I'll bring the forces of Hell to the shores of the Caribbean!  And I'll finally make Elaine my willing bride!  Mwah-hah-hahhhhh!
h1lc047a	You heard me, the Ultimate Insult!
h1lc047b	With its unholy power, I'll make the seas run red with the blood of my enemies!
h1lc047c	I'll bring the forces of Hell to the shores of the Caribbean!
h1lc047d	And I'll finally make Elaine my willing bride!  Mwah-hah-hahhhhh!
h2gb001	Honey, I'm ho...ome?
h2gb003	LeChuck!
h2gb005	No way!
h2gb007	Ozzie!  I had a feeling you were working for LeChuck!
h2gb009	Well that makes me feel better.
h2gb012	Don't do it, LeChuck!  He wants to use the Ultimate Insult to humiliate every pirate on the face of the Earth!
h2gb012a	Don't do it, LeChuck!  He wants to use the Ultimate Insult to humiliate 
h2gb012b	every pirate on the face of the Earth!
h2gb014	You know?
h2gb016	But why, LeChuck?  Why would a swashbuckling, albeit demonically evil, pirate like yourself willingly aid in the mass emasculation of your fellow buccaneers?
h2gb016a	But why, LeChuck?  Why would a swashbuckling, albeit demonically evil, 
h2gb016b	pirate like yourself willingly aid in the mass emasculation of your fellow buccaneers?
h2gb018	-Oh, no...
h2gb020	Fine, you owe the guy.  But why go along with this plan to irreversibly insult all the pirates?
h2gb020a	Fine, you owe the guy.
h2gb020b	But why go along with this plan to irreversibly insult all the pirates?
h2gb022	You don't mean-
h2gb024	Um, excuse me?  See the ring on this finger? You're a little late, bucko!
h2gb027	Uh. Yeah, ha ha, a hostage!  Besides, even if you kill me, Elaine'll still never marry you!  She hates your stinking undead guts!
h2gb027a	Uh. Yeah, ha ha, a hostage!
h2gb027b	Besides, even if you kill me, Elaine'll still never marry you!
h2gb027c	She hates your stinking undead guts!
h2gb030	Whoa, I'm a hostage, remember?
h2gb033	Yeah!  Hey, where is my meddlesome wife?
h2gb035	Good for her. I hope she comes back with an army of pirates and kicks your sorry butts.
h2gb035a	Good for her.
h2gb035b	I hope she comes back with an army of pirates and kicks your sorry butts.
h2gb041	Mwah-hah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha?
h2gb042	Speaking of perfect wives, where is Elaine?
h2lc002	Mwah-hah-hahhh!
h2lc004	That's 'Governor LeChuck' to you, Seepgood!
h2lc011	Ahr, it'd be a pleasure, Mister Mandrill.
h2lc013	And?
h2lc017	Well, that's a long story, Sheepgood-
h2lc019	-But it basically boils down to two reasons.  First of all..   ..this Mandrill scalawag pulled me out from under that mountain of ice that YOU left me under, and LeChuck ALWAYS repays his debts.
h2lc019a	-But it basically boils down to two reasons.  First of all this Mandrill scalawag
h2lc019b	pulled me out from under that mountain of ice that YOU left me under,
h2lc019c	and LeChuck ALWAYS repays his debts.
h2lc023	Yes, Elaine Marley's hand in marriage!
h2lc025	Well, I think I can fix that!
h2lc029	In other words, the perfect wife! Ha ha! Of course, there's still the small matter of her current husband-
h2lc029a	In other words, the perfect wife! Ha ha!
h2lc031	Are you sure I can't kill him yet?  I've left him alive before, and it's always turned out to be a big mistake.
h2lc031a	Are you sure I can't kill him yet?
h2lc031b	I've left him alive before, and it's always turned out to be a big mistake.
h2lc037	I still say we should run him through. Guybrush's accursed bungling has already scuttled three of my most nefarious plans.  I'd hate to see him do the same to yours.
h2lc039	Ha ha! That's a hellishly good idea. And I know just the place...Mwah-hah-hahhhh!
h2oz006	Yes way.
h2oz008	Ah'm afraid you got it backwards, pirate-boy. LeChuck's working for ME!
h2oz010	Governor LeChuck, would you be kind enough to relieve Mister Threepwood of the pieces to the Ultimate Insult.
h2oz010a	Governor LeChuck, would you be kind enough to relieve Mister Threepwood
h2oz010b	of the pieces to the Ultimate Insult.
h2oz015	Oh, of course he knows, ya sloth-brained pile of kookaburra droppings!
h2oz021	Because, you seafaring scum weasel, when we succeed in breaking the fighting spirit of all the pirates, LeChuck will finally have the one thing he's always wanted in life. Or death, as the case may be.
h2oz021a	Because, you seafaring scum weasel,
h2oz021b	when we succeed in breaking the fighting spirit of all the pirates,
h2oz021c	LeChuck will finally have the one thing he's always wanted in life.
h2oz021d	Or death, as the case may be.
h2oz026	LeChuck, no! We may need him as a hostage!
h2oz028	Ah, but that's the beauty of the Ultimate Insult, Threepwood. Once your wife has been exposed to its hideous, demoralizing power, her fiery pirate spirit will be shattered like so many emu eggs, leaving her compliant, submissive, and obedient. Heh heh.
h2oz028a	Ah, but that's the beauty of the Ultimate Insult, Threepwood.
h2oz028b	Once your wife has been exposed to its hideous, demoralizing power,
h2oz028c	her fiery pirate spirit will be shattered like so many emu eggs,
h2oz028d	leaving her compliant, submissive, and obedient. Heh heh.
h2oz032	No, we might need him in case his meddlesome wife shows up, trying to do something heroic.
h2oz034	We were hoping that you could answer that question, Mister Threepwood. Your mischievous Sheila went walkabout right after Captain LeChuck was elected governor of this pirate-infested backwater of an island.
h2oz034a	We were hoping that you could answer that question, Mister Threepwood.
h2oz034b	Your mischievous Sheila went walkabout right after Captain LeChuck
h2oz034c	was elected governor of this pirate-infested backwater of an island.
h2oz036	Well, that settles it then. We'll definitely need to keep this dorky drongo around as a hostage.
h2oz038	I see your point. How about we stow the twerp in an inescapable far away place where he can't do any harm? Then he'll still be a useful hostage, but he won't be able to affect our plans?
h2oz038a	I see your point.
h2oz038b	How about we stow the twerp in an inescapable
h2oz038c	far away place where he can't do any harm?
h2oz038d	Then he'll still be a useful hostage, but he won't be able to affect our plans?
h2oz040	Mwah-hah-haaaah!
habshi001	I told you, you don't have the authority to...
habshi002	What's this?
habshi003	Oh, I see.  Mmm, hmm.
habshi004	Well, I guess you ARE an important person.  Right this way, Mrs. Marley.  Let me show you to your ship.
habshi005	This...is the 'Dainty Lady'.
habshi006	You've obviously got a seaman's eye for nautical details.
habshi007	Now, there are a couple of regulations that I'm required to explain to you.
habshi008	First, bring it back in the same (or better) condition as it is now.
habshi009	Second, life preservers are to be worn by all crew and passengers at all times.
habshi010	Finally, this vehicle is to be used for official business only, so....
habshi011	...NO JOYRIDING!
habshi012	I suppose.
habshi013	Oh, and enjoy your voyages on the 'Dainty Lady'.
habshi014	Well, I'd love to hang out here on the docks with you all day...
habshi015	...actually, that's a lie.  I can't stand to be near you.  Bye!
habshi016	Hey!  What's all this junk doing here, cluttering up my shipyard?
habshi017	Yeah, yeah.  I've seen it.
habshi018	Well, it's back to work for me.
habshi019	How nice for you.
habshi020	And just what do you want me to do about it?
habshi021	It would be, if you had a boat.
habshi022	Go away.  I'm on a break.
habshi023	No.
habshi024	I am the Harbor MISTRESS.
habshi025	My full title is 'Chief Assistant Shipyard Regulator, Harbor Operations, Mêlée Island™.'
habshi026	A division of Inter-Island Transportation Services.
habshi027	Which means I'm in charge of ship allocations on Mêlée Island™.
habshi028	I am.
habshi029	My full title is 'Chief Assistant Shipyard Regulator, Harbor Operations, Mêlée Island™.'
habshi030	Not so fast, civilian.
habshi031	I am the Chief Assistant Shipyard Regulator, Harbor Operations, Mêlée Island™.
habshi032	What?  Are you trying to seduce a government employee?
habshi033	You're just jealous of my cushy government job.
habshi034	It would be even better if I didn't have to put up with the likes of you.
habshi035	Not so fast, mister.
habshi036	No boat leaves this harbor without my permission.
habshi037	And I see no reason to give you permission to take one of my boats.
habshi038	But, ah, I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about...
habshi039	I am not.
habshi040	Besides, I haven't taken my clothes off in years.
habshi041	Nope.  Don't know anything about 'em.
habshi042	And I can't stand sailing.
habshi043	I'm just paying my dues until I get a supervisor's job.
habshi044	Don't say I didn't give you anything.
habshi045	Name dropping won't get you a boat.
habshi046	I heard she was dead.
habshi047	Oh, so she's just been on vacation all this time, huh?  That's nice.  She won't be governor for long.
habshi048	I'm voting for Mister Charles.  He promised me a promotion.
habshi049	The rules prohibit the Shipyard Regulator...
habshi050	...that would be me...
habshi051	from lending a boat to anyone who does not have proper authority.
habshi052	That would be you.
habshi053	Helping is NOT part of my job description.
habshi054	Okay.  But remember, I'm not required to do this.
habshi055	As a civil servant, and Chief Assistant Shipyard Regulator...
habshi056	...I am here for your safety, not to be helpful.
habshi057	But if it'll make you go away, I'll tell you.
habshi058	I cannot, and will not, release a ship to any person, party, or entity...
habshi059	...that does not carry the authority of office,
habshi060	or is otherwise important in their own right.
habshi061	I really hope that you aren't trying to bribe an employee of the Mêlée Island™ government.
habshi062	Not that I care what happens to you, but I really don't want to fill out the paperwork.
habshi063	Nope.  It's simple.
habshi064	Prove to me that you have the authority to requisition a ship, and I will follow procedure to supply one.
habshi065	Not for you or anyone.
habshi066	Rules were meant to be followed.
habshi067	Just prove to me that you have the authority to requisition a ship, and I will follow procedure to supply one.
habshi068	Now, that, I can do.
habshi069	He was an awful man.  He was good, but he wouldn't take his claws off me.
habshi070	Strange, too.  He had a bizarre fascination with wax.
habshi071	How do you think I got my last promotion.
habshi072	Why?
habshi073	I wasn't naked!
habshi074	I was 'artistically posed'.
habshi075	So much for flattery.
habshi076	Have a nice day.
habshi077	If there's nothing else, I've got more regulating to do.
habshi078	What about it?
habshi079	That was there for a ship we liquidated a few months ago.  The technicians haven't been by to remove the sign yet.
habshi080	That's not my job.
habshi081	Besides, they get all upset when we fix our own equipment.
habshi082	What's wrong with this one?
habshi083	Take it or leave it, ingrate.
habshi084	First, bring it back in the same (or better) condition as it is now.
habshi085	Second, life preservers are to be worn by all crew and passengers at all times.
habshi086	Finally, this vehicle is to be used for official business only, so....
habshi087	...NO JOYRIDING!
habshi088	I'm done.
habshi089	Actually, I think it's fuscia.
habshi090	I see it as more of a mauve.
habshi091	It's actually something called 'Blazing Popsicle'.
habshi092	This vehicle is registered to the government.
habshi093	It is not to be used for piracy.
habshi094	I get the feeling you're used to being laughed at.
habshi095	Yes, I think it suits you.
habshi096	If you're done complaining about this fine vessel, I have work to do.
habshi097	What do you want?
habshi098	Don't tell me you damaged it.
habshi099	I'd hate to have to fill out all that paperwork.
habshi100	Of course not.
habshi101	Not when anyone is looking, anyway.
habshi102	Fine, I suppose.  It looks like Mister Charles is ahead in the polls, which is good...
habshi103	..for me.
habshi104	His campaign promises include a new job title for yours truly.
habshi105	If there's nothing else, I'm overdue for a grog break.
habshi106	Live with it, pirate-boy.
habshi107	I'm beginning to think you aren't confident enough in your masculinity to handle sailing a pink ship.
habshi108	What did you say?
habshi109	That's not a problem.  Keep it as long as you want.
habshi110	When you bring it back, I have to fill out paperwork, and I'd just as soon put that off.
habshi111	Oh, we'll get our ship mechanics right on that, Mister Threepwood.
habshi112	Glad to hear it.
habshi113	I'm really getting tired of all this negative campaigning.
habshi114	LeChuck is dead.  Mister Charles has a solid record as a normal human being.
habshi115	Besides, weren't you the one that killed LeChuck?
habshi116	See?  Lies and distortions.
habshi117	Has she come by here and told me what a great job I'm doing?
habshi118	No!
habshi119	Has she come by here and promised me a promotion?
habshi120	All she's done is send her dorky husband down here to harass me for a ship.
habshi121	Oh no.  It's about economic growth, social programs for the under-privileged, health care, and education.
habshi122	Eh, who am I kidding.  Of course it's about my impending promotion.
habshi123	Fine by me.
habshi124	Are we done discussing politics?
habshi125	Otis, who's out there?
habshi126	What?
habshi127	No thanks.  They go straight to my hips.
hb1cpt001	Please, stop bothering me.
hb1cpt002	I'm harmless, really.
hb1cpt003	If you say so, sir.
hb1cpt004	Me, a fearsome pirate?
hb1cpt005	You must be mistaken, sir.  Nnnh... I wouldn't harm a fly.
hb1cpt006	Oh, dear.  That sounds far too violent and adventurous for me.
hb1cpt007	Puppets?  Eh, what puppets?
hb1cpt008	Yes, sir.  Very good, sir.
hb1cpt009	Puppet?  Eh...eh, what puppet?
hb1cpt010	There are no puppets here, sir.
hb1cpt011	This is my home, sir.
hb1cpt012	I know it's not much to look at, but it's actually quite roomy.
hb1cpt013	Mmm.  It's a humble home, but I'm a humble man.
hb1cpt014	Th-th-heh-the Ultimate Insult?
hb1cpt015	Uhhh uhh ahh! <Scream>
hb1cpt016	Thank you, kind sir.
hb1cpt017	Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-what's that?
hb1cpt018	Th-th-th-the Ultimate Insult!?
hb1cpt019	Uhhh uhh ahh! <Scream>
hb2cpt001	Arrr, I be Hellbeard the Unrepentant, the scourge of the seven seas!
hb2cpt002	You again?
hb2cpt003	Of course you've heard of me!  I'm the nastiest pirate in the world!
hb2cpt004	I, ahem, uh... look!  Over there!
hb2cpt005	Puppet?  There be no puppets here, boy!
hb2cpt006	There be only the unrelenting terror of Hellbeard!
hb2cpt007	Har-har-harrrrr!
hb2cpt008	Get this through your lice-infested skull, cabin boy:
hb2cpt009	There be no puppets, there be only Hellbeard!
hb2cpt010	Puppeteer!?
hb2cpt011	Hellbeard the Unrepentant is no man's puppet!!!  Arrrrr!!!
hb2cpt012	Talk to the hand, ya nosy scupper-scraper!
hb2cpt013	The Ultimate Insult!?
hb2cpt014	Never heard of it.
hb2cpt015	I SAID I never heard of it.
hb2cpt016	And you've got a lot of clothes for a monkey.  What's your point?
hb2cpt017	I HEARD those sarcastic 'quotes,' ya scab-covered whale-whipper!
hb2cpt018	Do I LOOK dead to you?
hb2cpt019	Arrrrr!
hb2cpt020	I'll be here.
hb2cpt021	FOOD!
hb2cpt022	GROG!
hb2cpt023	WENCHES!
hb2cpt024	BLOOD!
hb2cpt025	MEAT!
hb2cpt026	SHEEP!
hb2cpt027	MORE WENCHES!
hb2cpt028	SLEEP!
hb2cpt029	BELCHING!
hb2cpt030	SPITTING!
hb2cpt031	SCRATCHING!
hb2cpt032	RUM!
hb2cpt033	ICHOR!
hb2cpt034	VIOLENCE!
hb2cpt035	NAUGHTY!
hb2cpt036	FLATULENCE!
hb2cpt037	SCHADENFREUDE!
hb2cpt038	MAIMING!
hb2cpt039	BOOTY!
hb2kab001	Effette doily-sniffer!
hb2kab002	Pirate poseur!
hb2kab003	Girly-man!!
hb2kab004	IDIOT!!!
hb2kab005	DORK!!!
hb2kab006	SPAZZ!!!
hb2kab007	Arrr, ahoy there, Big Guybrush!
hb2kab008	Oh yeah?
hb2kab009	Yeah!
hb3cpt001	I'm Hellbeard the Unrepentant, of course.
hb3cpt002	You again?
hb3cpt003	He'd like to think that.
hb3cpt004	If you must...
hb3cpt005	He's not much of a conversationalist, though.
hb3cpt006	I'd rather you didn't.  Eh, we're trying to protect him.
hb3cpt007	Well, alright, but don't make any sudden moves.
hb3cpt008	You won't mention the Ultimate Insult again, will you?  He's very skittish about that.
hb3cpt009	Welllll, alright.
hb3cpt010	If only I didn't.
hb3cpt011	Many years ago, I was the last pirate to be exposed to the Ultimate Insult.
hb3cpt012	In one fell swoop, its devastating jibes utterly destroyed my once-indomitable ego.
hb3cpt013	It destroyed my ego.  What more do I need to know?
hb3cpt014	Because of that paranoid jerk, Admiral Casaba.
hb3cpt015	Whenever he sees three or more pirates talking, he assumes they're plotting some sort of mischief...
hb3cpt016	So he lobs a cannonball at them.
hb3cpt017	I don't know if you've noticed, but Casaba's not too bright.
hb3cpt018	Eighty years of living under the influence of the Ultimate Insult will do that.
hb3cpt019	...I think we're getting off track here.  Let's...let's get back to...
hb3cpt020	...Well, yes, but I think you need to rationalize...
hb3cpt021	...I see what you're saying, but let's try to focus on...
hb3cpt022	...Now you're just being obstinate.  What's important here is...
hb3cpt023	...Well, that's obvious, naturally.  But what about...
hb3cpt024	...No, no, no, no, no.  You're forgetting the importance of...
hb3cpt025	...Right, now we're getting somewhere.  Let's move on to...
hb3cpt026	I'll be here.
hegb002	Sorry!
hegb004	That's, um, great, I guess.  Uh. What about Ozzie Mandrill?
hegb006	Herman?
hegb008	I didn't know whales could stagger, but go ahead.
hegb010	Really?  What is it?
hegb012	Is this going to take a while? I'm in kind of a hurry.
hegb015	Australia?  Wait a minute...
hegb017	Sorry.
hegb019	No!
hegb021	So YOU were the one who told Ozzie about the lucrative development opportunities of the Caribbean.
hegb021a	So YOU were the one who told Ozzie about the
hegb021b	lucrative development opportunities of the Caribbean.
hegb024	I hate it when that happens.
hegb026	Yipes.
hegb028	Remind me to never tell you a secret.
hegb030	'H.T.?'  Wait a minute, you're not telling me that you're really-
hegb032	B-b-b-but you can't be Governor Marley! I mean. Everyone knows that H.T. Marley died over 20 years ago...off the coast of Australia...in a boat race...
hegb032a	B-b-b-but you can't be Governor Marley!
hegb032b	I mean. Everyone knows that H.T. Marley died over 20 years ago...
hegb032c	off the coast of Australia...in a boat race...
hegb033	Grandpa!!
hegb035	But sir, we're family, see?  I married your granddaughter, Elaine!
hegb037	That's no way to talk, Governor.  We've got to work together to save Mêlée Island™ from Ozzie and LeChuck!
hegb039	Um, well, actually, he's the new Governor of Mêlée Island™.
hegb041	She disappeared right after the election.
hegb043	Why?
hegb045	The one having to do with the Governorship of Mêlée Island™?  Elaine and I were wondering about that.  What is it?
hegb047	Yes?
hegb049	That looks like the Mêlée Island™ Gubernatorial Seal.
hegb051	I guess it's with Elaine.  She rarely lets it out of her sight.
hehn001	Ouch!  Uh. What in the name of-
hehn003	Hey, I just remembered where I left my pants!
hehn005	Ozzie Mandrill?  Never heard of him...Huh! Wait, now I remember!  Oh...no.  By Triton's panty line, this is horrible!
hehn007	Who?  Oh yeah, that's me.  'Herman.'  Heh. Heh. Heh. Listen, junior, you'd better take a seat, because I've got some whale-staggering news to lay on you.
hehn009	Okay, first of all, my real name isn't Herman Toothrot.
hehn011	I'll get to that. First, let me tell you how I ended up here on Monkey Island™, with nothing but a busted accordion, most of the clothes on my back, and a head full of broken memories.

hehn011b	with nothing but a broken accordion, most of the clothes on my back,
hehn011c	and a head full of broken memories.
hehn013	Stow it, blondie, this is important.
hehn014	Like so many stories, it began some twenty years ago in a bar on the other side of the world.  I had been lured out of my peaceful retirement in the Caribbean by the thrill of a dangerous sailing regatta off the coast of Australia.

hehn014d	by the thrill of a dangerous sailing regatta off the coast of Australia.
hehn016	Hush up, kid, I'm tellin' a story here.
hehn018	Anyhow, the night before the competition, I was steeling myself for the race with several pitchers of grog, when I was joined at the bar by one of the other competitors; an unhappy Australian tycoon with the unlikely name of Ozzie Mandrill.

hehn018c	when I was joined at the bar by one of the other competitors;
hehn018d	an unhappy Australian tycoon with the unlikely name of Ozzie Mandrill.
hehn020	Yes!  The poor guy seemed so sad, just because no one would do business with him anymore.  To cheer him up, I regaled him with stories of my adventures on the untamed Caribbean seas.
hehn020a	Yes!

hehn022	Yes, but that's not all!
hehn023	The next day, as I reached the race's halfway point, I'd already forgotten the grog-induced revelries of the night before.  Suddenly, I found myself being rammed by another boat, pushed into a freakish whirlpool.  It was none other than Ozzie.

hehn023d	pushed into a freakish whirlpool.
hehn023e	It was none other than Ozzie.
hehn025	It gets worse.
hehn027	I hadn't just told Ozzie about the wonders of the Caribbean; I'd also told him about all of its terrible voodoo secrets; secrets that men would kill to possess.  I'd told him about the Gate to Heck known as 'Big Whoop.'  I'd told him about the Unbelievable Lineage of the Three-Headed Monkey.  Worst of all, I'd told him about the Ultimate Insult, the voodoo talisman that could make mice out of men!

hehn029	Strangely, the whirlpool didn't kill me; instead it dropped me and my shattered ship on the other side of the world, bobbing in the middle of the Caribbean!  I washed up on the shore of this despicable isle, right over there.  Just as I started to crawl up the beach, a monstrous, debris filled wave crashed down upon me, smacking me square on the noggin with my cherished, monogrammed accordion. By the time I had righted myself, I had no idea who I was, or where I came from.  I took the name 'Herman Toothrot,' after the remaining letters on my accordion...'H.T.'

hehn031	That's right. My real name is Horatio...Torquemeda...Marley!
hehn034	Get your stinking hands offa me, ya blammed oct-ee-pus!
hehn036	Oh, that's just wonderful.  I finally rid myself of twenty years of amnesia, and the first thing I learn is that my granddaughter has married the sorriest excuse for a pirate in the seven seas.  Somebody get me a coconut so I can go back to being blissfully ignorant...
hehn036a	Oh, that's just wonderful.
hehn036b	I finally rid myself of twenty years of amnesia,

hehn036d	has married the sorriest excuse for a pirate in the seven seas.
hehn036e	Somebody get me a coconut so I can go back to being blissfully ignorant...
hehn038	LeChuck's involved, too?
hehn040	Gadzooks!  Then what's happened to my granddaughter?
hehn042	Whew, that's a relief!
hehn044	Because of the ONE secret I didn't tell Ozzie; the secret of the fourth piece of the Ultimate Insult.
hehn046	It's...
hehn048	This!
hehn050	It IS the Mêlée Island™ Gubernatorial Seal.  Uh. One of them, anyway.  Ya see. A good governor always keeps a spare around, in case the original gets lost. He he he.  The Seal is the key to unlocking the dread power of the Ultimate Insult; uh without it, it's just a weird-looking maraca.  Tell me, Guybrush, where is the other Gubernatorial Seal?
hehn052	Ah. That's good.  As long as Ozzie and LeChuck don't find her, they'll never be able to make the Ultimate Insult work.
hergom001	Stealing my gold, sonny?
hergom002	Heh.  Good luck!  The mine went dry years ago!
hergom003	Drier than a dead monkey!  Heh heh!
hergom004	Whelp, see ya around, miner-boy!
herlav001	Nice lava, isn't it?  Doesn't keep the monkeys away, though!
herlav002	Nothin' like a brisk walk among the lava fields, I always say.  Heh heh heh.
herlav003	Careful there, sonny jim.  It'd be a shame if you accidentally fell into the all-consuming magma.  Heh heh heh heh.
herlav004	That landlubbin' lava melted my hut!
hermob001	Darn monkeys!  Been stealing my bananas again!
hermob002	Heh!  Keep your hands off my stash, sonny boy.
hermob003	Don't even think about taking those!
hermob004	Nice bananas.  They look a lot like the ones that were stolen from me.
hersco001	Nice view, eh?
hersco002	Darndest thing, ain't it?
hersco003	When the theme park exploded, the winds of hell that were unleashed battered this lookout into what you see now.
hersco004	Weird, huh!
hersco005	Nice shot, Binky!
hersco006	Well, gotta go.  Rest break is over.
hertoc001	Where?
hertoc002	I am?  Who are you?
hertoc003	If you say so.  Heh.
hertoc004	Is it?  I can't remember.
hertoc005	I don't remember.  Heh.
hertoc006	This is an island?
hertoc007	Get him -- I'm the one with no memory, and he wants MY help.
hertoc008	Heh.
hertoc009	You really must be desperate if you need advice from a brain-damaged hermit.  Heh heh heh.
hertoc010	Who?
hertoc011	Mostly a lot of staggering around.
hertoc012	Then a weird kid named 'Sheepgood' showed up and told me my name was 'Herman.'
hertoc013	I remember being asked a bunch of nosy questions, fancy boy.
hertoc014	This isn't some sort of regression therapy, is it?
hertoc015	Cause I don't wanna wake up thinking that I'd been kidnapped by aliens or somethin'.
hertoc016	Lessee...uh...eh...umm...ow!
hertoc017	I remember waking up next to my hammock, with a bump on my noggin!
hertoc018	Oh, a couple of hours ago.
hertoc019	I guess not.  Is that a bad thing?  I can't remember.
hertoc020	Not since I woke up next to my hammock, no.
hertoc021	Whatever.  Heh heh.
hertoc022	I have a ship?  I thought I was a hermit.
hertoc023	Do I have a cell phone, too?
hertoc024	A hermit with a ship...jeez.
hertoc025	Nope.  Of course, I don't put much stock in this mythical 'hermit ship' of yours.
hertoc026	What's that?
hertoc027	Voodoo?  What's that?
hertoc028	Who and who?
hertoc029	Try to make it something recent, pants boy.  Heh heh heh.
hertoc030	Guybrush Threepwood?'  Heh heh heh.  And I thought my name was stupid.
hertoc031	If you're my best friend, where were you when I lost my memory?
hertoc032	Where'd you take it?
hertoc033	Ow!
hertoc034	What the heck're you tryin ta--?  Hey!
hertoc035	I'm Herman Toothrot!
hertoc036	Some of it.  I still don't remember you.
hertoc037	That's me.
hertoc038	I don't know.  Ask me something.
hertoc039	Things?  What things?
hertoc040	It's your dime, Spanky.
hertoc041	I could tell that just by looking at ya.
hertoc042	I'll bet.  Heh heh heh.
hertoc043	See ya, stranger.
hertoc044	Well, I remember building this campground.
hertoc045	And trying to keep the monkeys from stealing my bananas.
hertoc046	Then some bozo whacked me with a coconut.
hertoc047	I remember being annoyed by some fancy-pants pirate.
hertoc048	Hmmm, let me think...
hertoc049	I remember waking up in the middle of a clearing next to a milk bottle.
hertoc050	Yup.  Probably had something to do with all the explosions going on at the amusement park.
hertoc051	Yup.  Some sort of demon/zombie/ghost pirate blew up the place real good, then sailed off on his ghost ship.
hertoc052	All the explosions activated the island's dormant volcano.
hertoc053	A few months ago.
hertoc054	That's right.  I can't remember a thing before I woke up next to that milk bottle.
hertoc055	Nope.
hertoc056	Never heard of it.
hertoc057	Who're they?
hertoc058	If you want my help, ask me some questions I can answer.
hertoc059	I think they spend most of their time on the other side of the lava field.
hertoc060	Dirty little buggers.
hertoc061	A talking monkey?  Heh heh heh.  Are you sure YOU'RE not the one with the brain damage?
hertoc062	A talking monkey...heh heh heh heh.
hertoc063	Wouldn't you like to know?
hertoc064	Oh.  Well, when the volcano erupted, it ripped open the island's southern canyon.
hertoc065	Guess what I found down there?
hertoc066	I've had to stop.
hertoc067	I kept hitting a big, metal wall.
hertoc068	Yup.  Who knew?
hertoc069	Don't remind me, Squinky.
hertoc070	All that gold, and I can't get to it.
hertoc071	(sob)
hertoc072	No, but hum a few bars and I'll fake it.
hertoc073	BWAH-HA-HAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
hertoc074	Get it?
hertoc075	Well, it's new to me.
hertoc076	Ahh, he's a good kid...for a ghost.
hertoc077	He just needs a new hobby.
hertoc078	Yup.
hertoc079	The only thing that seems to cheese him off is that 'Anti-LeChuck' character he keeps rambling about.
hertoc080	Okey-Dokey.
hertoc081	Gold!
hertoc082	Buckets of the stuff!
hertoc083	I've been mining ever since.
hertoc084	I even had my banana picker dipped in gold.
hertoc085	Insurance, bucko.  The high-flyin' life of a hermit's fine and dandy now, but I may want to retire someday!
hertoc086	Ow!
hertoc087	Are ya tryin' to kill me, ya rassin-frassin'--
hertoc088	Guybrush!
hertoc089	Of course.  You're the kid who found my banana picker!
hertoc090	Threepwood?
hertoc091	I think so.  Quiz me, hotshot.
hertoc092	Try me, monkey boy!
hertoc093	?
hertoc094	Don't ya always?
hertoc095	So what else is new?  Heh.
hertoc096	Those jerks!
hertoc097	They used to keep stealing my banana picker.
hertoc098	Boy, was I happy when they moved away.
hertoc099	Yup.  Kinda silly, if ya ask me...
hertoc100	...stickin' an amusement park on a nigh-unreachable, mystically obscured island.
hertoc101	Well, that's LeChuck for ya...a nasty piece of work, but not too bright.
hertoc102	I wish I could forget.
hertoc103	I'm still not sure how I ended up there.
hertoc104	Really?  Well, don't that beat all...
hertoc105	Oh, yeah.  The 'Caverns of Meat.'  Heh heh heh heh.
hertoc106	Those caves mysteriously sealed up after you left.
hertoc107	It's a good thing, too.  We were losing a lot of monkeys down there.
hertoc108	I remember lots of stuff.
hertoc109	I especially remember a snot-nosed kid who wouldn't let a hermit have a little peace and quiet.
hertoc110	That's a long time ago, skippy.
hertoc111	Hmmm...I remember...it's twenty years ago...I'm washing ashore on Monkey Island™.
hertoc112	...my head hurts...
hertoc113	There's an accordion next to me, on the beach.
hertoc114	Yup.  I tried to play the thing for a few years, but I wasn't any good, so I threw it into a field of weeds.
hertoc115	Of course I do.
hertoc116	It's at the bottom of the ocean.
hertoc117	A few months ago I got to thinkin' that a hermit with a ship is like a unicycle with training wheels...
hertoc118	...it just doesn't make much sense.
hertoc119	So, in the spirit of genuine hermit-idity, I sank it.
hertoc120	Don't know, and I don't care.
hertoc121	I'm a full-time hermit now!
hertoc122	That sounds familiar.  Uh, what is it?
hertoc123	Ultimate Insult...Ultimate Insult...nope, never heard of it.
hertoc124	Why is that name so familiar?
hertoc125	No, twerpo, the other one!
hertoc126	I...don't...know.  I...I think...maybe...
hertoc127	Nope.  I guess I don't.
hertoc128	Well, LeChuck you can beat by taking advantage of the fact that he's a big dope.
hertoc129	As for Ozzie...Ozzie... <Sigh>  Nope.  Can't help ya.
hertoc130	Suits me.
hertoc131	Call me Horatio, kid.  Neptune knows I'M gonna have to get used to it again.
hertoc132	Yup?
hertoc133	How does it feel?  Let's see...
hertoc134	BEFORE you hit me with that accordion, I was a carefree hermit on a tropical island.
hertoc135	NOW... I've got a dimwit for a grandson-in-law,
hertoc136	a granddaughter who's imperiled by not one, but two beings of unspeakable evil,
hertoc137	and the knowledge that every pirate in the Tri-Island Area might be wiped out by a mistake I made over twenty years ago!
hertoc138	How do YOU think I feel, Seepgood!?
hertoc139	Grrrr.
hertoc140	You shouldn't have to, as long as my granddaughter keeps the Gubernatorial Symbol away from those goons.
hertoc141	Hmmm, that's tricky.  I suppose you could just build a bigger Ultimate Insult talisman.  That might work.  But--
hertoc142	If you wanted it to generate Ultimate COMEBACKS, you'd have to master the ancient tongue of the Ultimate Insult.
hertoc143	Pretty dang hard.  It's really ancient.
hertoc144	It's monkey jabber.
hertoc145	Yup.  Pretty ancient, huh?
hertoc146	Cripes, my granddaughter musta had a lobotomy after I left.
hertoc147	Listen carefully, spanky:
hertoc148	First of all, you gotta build a BIG version of the Ultimate Insult...
hertoc149	You'll use this to generate Ultimate Comebacks.
hertoc150	While you're doing that, find some monkeys, so you can master the ancient language of the Ultimate Insult.
hertoc151	Lastly, and this is most important...
hertoc152	Stop bugging me!
hertoc153	Splinky, I have no idea.
hertoc154	Right now I'd trade all the gold in my mine to bring back my creaky old ship.
hertoc155	Not if I see you first.
hertoc156	Quit calling me that!
hertoc158	Gadzooks!  Where's my granddaughter?
hertoc159	Because of the one secret I didn't reveal to Ozzie before he tried to kill me.
hertoc160	Of course not!  I'm talking about the secret of the fourth piece of the Ultimate Insult!
hertoc161	It's...THIS!
hertoc162	It IS the official Gubernatorial Seal of Mêlée Island™.  Uh, one of them, anyway.
hertoc163	A good governor always keeps a spare around, in case the original gets lost.
hertoc164	The Seal is the key to unlocking the dread power of the Ultimate Insult; without it, it's just a funky-looking maraca.
hertoc165	Now Guybrush, this is very important: where is the other Gubernatorial Seal?
hertoc167	Like I said: As long as Ozzie and LeChuck don't find Elaine, the Ultimate Insult can never be completed.
hertow001	What in the name of Poseidon's pig-sticker is that!?
hertow002	An amplifier...of course.
hertow003	Guybrush, this tower is part of Ozzie's fiendish plot!
hertow004	What the flimdy-flam are you talking about?
hertow005	Ozzie's gonna use that tower to amplify the effects of an Ultimate Insult a millionfold,
hertow006	so he can simultaneously expose every pirate in the Tri-Island Area to the devastating effects of the Ultimate Insult!
hertow007	Are ya trying ta get us kilt?
hertow008	I can't believe my granddaughter married you.
hertow009	Quit lollygagin'!
hertow010	Stop kidding around, and climb the blammed tower!
inel010a	Eh...ha...cha!
inel010b	Yah!
inel010c	Ugh...ha.
inel010d	Yah....ugh...ah.
inel010e	Ugh...ugh....yah.
inel012a	Oh, my little snugglecakes.
ingb001	From the personal log of Guybrush Threepwood:  Sometimes, when it's quiet, I can still hear the monkeys.  It's hard to believe that it's only been a few years since I first washed up on the beaches of Mêlée Island™, armed with nothing more than a goofy name and an overpowering urge to become a swashbuckling pirate.

ingb014	That's the second biggest Monkey Head I've ever seen!

jojmon001	Greetings.
jojmon002	Welcome to Monkey Town.
jojmon003	I...I am Jojo Jr., Monkey Prince.
jojmon004	Ack
jojmon005	Oop
jojmon006	Eek
jojmon007	Chee
jojmon008	You are indeed ready to fight me.
jojmon009	Let's see if you can beat the master.
jojmon010	Bring it on, flesh-boy.
jojmon011	You are good, but are you good enough?
jojmon012	You must practice more, my son, if you ever want to give me a challenge.
jojmon013	You are not ready to fight me.
jojmon014	You are improving, but your skills are still too weak.
jojmon015	Nice effort, but you need more discipline.
jojmon016	Practice with the lesser monkeys, then come see me again.
jojmon017	I cannot believe it.  I had foreseen losing my crown eventually, but not to such an unlikely opponent.
jojmon018	The honor of victory is yours, Guybrush, as well as the ceremonial bronze hat.
jojmon019	Please take good care of it; it is very special.
jojmon020	Greetings, unenlightened one.
jojmon021	As can you.  Imagine that.
jojmon022	That is why you fail.
jojmon023	The question is not, why a talking monkey, but rather, why not a talking monkey?
jojmon024	Thank you.  It is a hat of honor.
jojmon025	No.
jojmon026	The want of things is the core of the human experience.
jojmon027	It's good to want things.
jojmon028	I don't have a ship, if that's what you are asking.
jojmon029	E...everyone who leaves Monkey Island™ finds their own path.
jojmon030	I foresee a unique path for you, of an epic nature.
jojmon031	Or perhaps I'm hungry again.
jojmon032	No.  No details.
jojmon033	Since the Great Summoning.
jojmon034	Shut your yap, impatient one, and I shall tell you.
jojmon035	The brotherhood of primates has a unique bond with the whole world that surrounds us.
jojmon036	No one has any respect for history.
jojmon037	A...anyway, my monkey brethren have felt a need, a calling, to amass here.
jojmon038	There is a feeling that something wonderful will happen soon.
jojmon039	Something BIG.
jojmon040	Even I do not know the answers to such questions.
jojmon041	Every monkey in the Caribbean has gathered here, and yet none of them know why.
jojmon042	I can only imagine it will be something BIG.
jojmon043	What enlightenment can I bestow upon you?
jojmon044	I question your readiness to confront me, but very well...
jojmon045	I can see you've been training.  Perhaps you are ready to fulfill the prophecies...
jojmon046	Very well...
jojmon047	Monkey Koooooombaaaaaat!
jojmon048	No, but it psyches out my opponents.
jojmon049	I wish you luck and health on your journey.
jojmon050	I feel that I cannot help you more at this time.
jojmon051	You must begin the next leg of your journey.
jojmon052	Besides, I have pressing business to attend to.
jojmon053	Precisely.  Why not?
jojmon054	On a warm sunny day, much like this one...
jojmon055	...I...I was in the clearing next to the Giant Monkey Head, burying my dearly departed father.
jojmon056	Jojo Sr.
jojmon057	We found him still clutching a branch that operated the gate to the Monkey Head.
jojmon058	By the look of things, he had been helping someone to get inside the gate, and hadn't been told to stop.
jojmon059	He was very loyal, I am told.
jojmon060	Anyway, he hadn't moved in over ten years, and eventually starved.
jojmon061	Yes.  Well, I was just completing the grim task, and I heard a low humming coming from the Giant Monkey Head.
jojmon062	Oh, being a curious monkey by nature, I cautiously approached the humming Head, and reached out my hand towards its massive mouth.
jojmon063	As I touched it, a tremendous bolt shot through my body, knocking me unconscious.
jojmon064	When I came to, I discovered that I had an enormous understanding of the world around me.
jojmon065	Oh, that, too.
jojmon066	Of course they do!
jojmon067	Oh, ha ha!  You mean, do they talk in your language?
jojmon068	No, I am the only one.
jojmon069	Yes?
jojmon070	As interesting as this may be to you, I feel we might be straying from what is important.
jojmon071	Oh, that is a question only the stars and the heavens themselves can answer.
jojmon072	To earn the right to wear this hat, one must become the best at an ancient and noble sport.
jojmon073	A contest with great and long-standing tradition among the monkey-folk.
jojmon074	The sport of Monkey Kombat.
jojmon075	Why yes, yes it is.
jojmon076	It's darn heavy, too.
jojmon077	Me too.
jojmon078	That is all we know.
jojmon079	And even that is nothing more than a hunch.
jojmon080	But it is the only explanation for this impromptu monkey reunion.
jojmon081	How did YOU know to come here?
jojmon082	And so it is for my monkey brethren.
jojmon083	No, they came of their own accord, but they don't know why.
jojmon084	I was only trying to illustrate their lack of power to fight it, much like you... ah, oh, forget it.
jojmon085	Various ways.
jojmon086	Each monkey has found their own path.
jojmon087	Your path is yours to find.
jojmon088	Then what would you like to talk about?
jojmon089	I have no more insight for you.  Perhaps you seek knowledge in other areas?
jojmon090	It was once used to train young monkey warriors in the way of combat.
jojmon091	In these modern times, it has become a game, albeit a game of supreme honor.
jojmon092	Very little has changed over the years.
jojmon093	Much of the ceremony has been dropped, but the flinging of insults and witty monkey repartee has remained.
jojmon094	Pay attention, this may seem complicated to you.
jojmon095	There are four basic words used in Monkey Kombat.
jojmon096	They are the most ancient of all the words in the monkey language.
jojmon097	Learn them well.  Eek, Oop, Ack, and Chee.
jojmon098	Insults are flung at your opponent by combining these words, as in 'Oop Eek Chee!'
jojmon099	Any combination will do.
jojmon100	There are four ways to respond to such insults.
jojmon101	The Stall, the Deflection, and the Comeback.
jojmon102	Utter Failure.
jojmon103	To Stall, simply repeat the phrase.
jojmon104	To Deflect, match the pattern of your opponent's insult, and add a word to the end.
jojmon105	To make a Comeback, flip the pattern using any word, and add a word to the end.
jojmon106	Contests always start with three words, and grow with each Deflection or Comeback.
jojmon107	A successful stall starts the contest over.
jojmon108	The best way to learn is to try it against the monkeys wandering around the island.
jojmon109	For example.  You are insulted with 'Eek Chee Oop Ack'.
jojmon110	The Stall response would be 'Eek Chee Oop Ack'.
jojmon111	For example.  You are insulted with 'Eek Chee Eek'.
jojmon112	First, replace each word with another while keeping the pattern.
jojmon113	Like this: 'Oop Ack Oop'.
jojmon114	Then, add a word to the end, like, 'Chee'.
jojmon115	'Oop Ack Oop Chee!'
jojmon116	To formulate a Comeback, flip the pattern of your opponent's insult, and add a word to the end.
jojmon117	For example.  You are insulted with 'Eek Chee Chee'.
jojmon118	First, reverse the pattern substituting any words.
jojmon119	Like this: 'Ack Ack Oop'.
jojmon120	Then, add a word to the end, like, 'Eek'.
jojmon121	'Ack Ack Oop Eek!'
jojmon122	Yes.  The one who is the best at Monkey Kombat earns the honor of the sacred hat.
jojmon123	Easy there.  First, you must prove yourself worthy by defeating some of the others.
jojmon124	Only after you've done that will I accept a challenge.
jojmon125	And if you are able to defeat me, the champion of Monkey Kombat...
jojmon126	...a highly unlikely occurrence...
jojmon127	...then you shall be awarded the Hat of Honor.
jojmon128	Then we shall take a break.
jojmon129	Thanks.  As I said, it's a Hat of Honor.
jojmon130	You are not ready for me, pink boy.  Return after you have defeated some lesser monkeys.
jojmon131	You're still not prepared to face me, hairless one.  Humble a few more monkeys, then we'll see if you're worthy.
jojmon132	I can see that you've been training, Threepwood, but you're still not ready.
jojmon133	Apparently, someone had trained the poor, loyal fool to grab the switch that controlled the gate to the Giant Monkey Head...
jojmon134	...but that same stupid someone forgot to train my father to LET GO of the switch.
jojmon135	Eventually, my father starved to death, swinging on a switch, waiting for a simple command that never came.
jojmon136	Gimpy Gibbon
jojmon137	Charging Chimp
jojmon138	Bobbing Baboon
jojmon139	Anxious Ape
jojmon140	Drunken Monkey
jojmon141	Pay attention; I don't want to have to say this again.
jojmon142	There are five Battle Stances in Monkey Kombat:
jojmon143	The Gimpy Gibbon...
jojmon144	The Charging Chimp...
jojmon145	The Bobbing Baboon...
jojmon146	The Anxious Ape...
jojmon147	And the Drunken Monkey...
jojmon148	Each of these stances is dominant over two other stances.
jojmon149	For example, the
jojmon150	always defeats the
jojmon151	Yes, but there's more to it than that.
jojmon152	In order to move from one Battle Stance to another, you must invoke certain Secret Monkey Insults.
jojmon153	These insults are built from combinations of the four most ancient words in the monkey language:
jojmon154	Eek.
jojmon155	Ack.
jojmon156	Oop.
jojmon157	And Chee.
jojmon158	For example, if I wanted to move from the Drunken Monkey stance to the Anxious Ape, I would use the following insult:
jojmon159	Any questions?
jojmon160	The Gimpy Gibbon...
jojmon161	The Charging Chimp...
jojmon162	The Bobbing Baboon...
jojmon163	The Anxious Ape...
jojmon164	And the Drunken Monkey...
jojmon165	Certainly...
jojmon166	I'm afraid not.  Each Monkey Kombatant must earn the knowledge of the sacred monkey insults through actual Monkey Kombat.
jojmon167	Yes...well...the first one's free.
jojmon168	There is no way to master Monkey Kombat without experiencing Monkey Kombat.
jojmon169	However, when I was a younger monkey, I found that employing the 'Monkey See, Monkey Do' strategy allowed me to quickly master several simple moves.
jojmon170	It also irritated my opponents.
jojmon171	Unfortunately, I am on duty and could not possibly take the time to enjoy a banana.  But thank you for the kind offer.
jojmon177	Don't forget, that the same insult works for the return move, as well.
jojmon178	Only that you may hold your current position by repeating any of the primal words three times in a row.
jojmon179	Simply copy your opponent's insults.  You'll lose many battles, but you'll learn many moves.
jojmon180	Verrrry interesting.
jojmon181	The monkeys choose their own path, I have no control over them.
jojmon182	Although, they DO show great respect to the wearer of the Hat of Honor.
jojmon183	They will come, when the time is right.
jojmon184	I can also use the same insult to move from the Anxious Ape stance back to the Drunken Monkey.
jojtow001	Unless I miss my guess, that's an Ultimate Insult Amplification Tower.
jojtow002	If you wish to fulfill your destiny and save your pirate friends, you must climb this tower and destroy its devilish machinery.
jojtow003	Let go, Guybrush.  Not literally, of course.
jojtow004	Trust your feelings, Guybrush.  And try not to get us killed.
jojtow005	BE the Giant Monkey Robot, Guybrush.
jojtow006	To get to the bottom of Ozzie's plan, you must get to the top of his tower.
jumkab001	Who ARE you, you annoying little miscreant?
jumkab002	Jumbeaux LaFeet, last of the LaFeet pirates!
jumkab003	Imagine my delight.
jumkab004	That dreadful Admiral Casaba person.
jumkab005	Every time he sees three or more pirates talking, he thinks there's a conspiracy afoot.
jumkab006	So he begins to lob cannonballs at us.
jumkab007	If I weren't so comfortable here on the beach, I'd sail out there and give him a piece of my mind.
jumkab008	Because he's delusional and paranoid.
jumkab009	Every time he sees three or more pirates talking, he thinks we're plotting an invasion of Jambalaya Island™.
jumkab010	So he starts firing his cannon.
jumkab011	Really?  I hadn't noticed.
jumkab012	You know, I can't really tell anymore.
jumkab013	In any event, these are, in fact, my parrots.
jumkab014	I call them Huggyn and Kyssin.
jumkab015	I don't know.  They're identical twins.
jumkab016	It's too bad, too.
jumkab017	Because they're SPECIAL parrots.
jumkab018	I don't know.
jumkab019	Whenever I ask 'em a question,
jumkab020	they fly around until I can't tell which one is which anymore.
jumkab021	<Sigh>  It's very frustrating.
jumkab022	Figured that one out all by yourself, did ya?
jumkab023	What's that?
jumkab024	Woo... sounds dreadful.
jumkab025	Tiny LaFeet was my...father.
jumkab026	<Sniff>...Okay.
jumkab027	Good-bye, little pirate.
jumkab028	No!
jumkab029	My daddy was everything a REAL pirate should be...
jumkab030	...violent...
jumkab031	...vulgar...
jumkab032	...psychotic...
jumkab033	Pirates lined up for miles to spit on his grave... <sob> <sniff>
jumkab034	It's those soul-less cretins at Ozzie Mandrill Enterprises.
jumkab035	They're using my father's name and image...as
jumkab036	...'happy' icons for their new 'family-friendly' Jambalaya Island™.
jumkab037	You should have seen my mother.
jumkab038	She had a picture of Monkey Island™ tattooed on her butt.
jumkab039	'Actual Size.'
jumkab040	I happened to it.
jumkab041	To lend a touch of 'authenticity' to their precious statue,
jumkab042	Mandrill's flunkies bronzed my father's captain's hat, and welded it to the statue.
jumkab043	Enraged by this sacrilege, I gathered some pirates and raided Jambalaya Island™.
jumkab044	Before anyone knew what happened, I rescued my father's chapeau, returned to Knuttin Atoll, and buried my treasure!
jumkab045	Oh, thanks.  Unfortunately, my raid inspired Mandrill to hire Casaba to patrol the waters of Knuttin.
jumkab046	Now, Knuttin Atoll is nothing more than a prison for recalcitrant pirates who don't share Ozzie Mandrill's 'vision'.
jumkab047	I know I buried it under a boulder along the beach...
jumkab048	I just don't know which one!
jumkab049	I don't know...why do you want it?
jumkab050	Really?  Oh, that's great!
jumkab051	If you can find it, eh, feel free to use it.
jumkab052	How wonderful!
jumkab053	Oh, I'm sorry.  I can't.
jumkab054	I permanently threw my back out the last time I moved that rock.
jumkab055	My days of lifting heavy objects are officially over.
jumkab056	Yeah, it's too bad Admiral Casaba confiscated all our explosives.
jumkab057	Of course not.
jumkab058	But they ARE cursed with powerful voodoo magic.
jumkab059	One of them always tells the truth.
jumkab060	The other one always lies.
jumkab061	Isn't that right, fellas?
jumkab062	Oh, <sigh> if I knew which one was which, they'd be tremendously useful.
jumkab063	As it is, they're rather annoying.
jumkab064	Outro
jumkab065	What do ya think you're doing!?
jumkab066	He'll see us, you ignoramus!
jumkab067	Uh, you may wanna move a couple of feet to your left.
jumkab068	You're welcome.  Now go away so I can resume my discussion with the delightful Miss Daisy.
kahpla001	The winner, and still All-World Plank Diving Champion, is Marco de Pollo!
kahpla002	We move on to the tiebreaker round.
kahpla003	Well done, young one.  By tying de Pollo, you've earned the right to face him in another tiebreaker round.
kahpla004	It was a close one, but our winner is still...Marco de Pollo!
kahpla005	Ladies and Gentlemen...
kahpla006	It would be most unwise to try to bribe a diving judge!
kahpla007	Aloha, Grasshopper.
kahpla008	We are the judges for Jambalaya's All-World Diving Contest.
kahpla009	If you wish to dive, you must be certified first.
kahpla010	Now if you'll just step behind the table...
kahpla011	Now then, let me know when this begins to hurt...
kahpla012	Be that as it may, you have passed the physical.
kahpla013	It is awarded to the winner of the All-World Plank Diving Contest.
kahpla014	Ooh!  Only the winners of the All-World Plank Diving Contest are allowed to touch the trophy.
kahpla015	Or perhaps the Rolling Regis?
kahpla016	No.
kahpla017	Aloha.
kahpla018	Yes, Grasshopper?
kahpla019	Ooh, that is an exceptionally grave charge, young mackerel.
kahpla020	Do you have any proof?
kahpla021	Is anyone here taking bribes?
kahpla022	If I were you, I'd refrain from making baseless accusations in the future.
kahpla023	Not a thing, my young friend.
kahpla024	You slid into the water with admirable grace.
kahpla025	Because his splash was even smaller.  I would not have thought such a thing possible if I had not seen it with my own two eyes.
kahpla026	The perfect dive should leave no trace of the diver upon the water.
kahpla027	As you seek perfection in your dives, seek perfection in your splashes.
kahpla028	Yes.  You might try making your form more, ah, aerodynamic, like that of a swordfish.
kahpla029	Your splashes are still too large to be aesthetically pleasing.
kahpla030	I fear that the top of your head is too flat to compete.
kahpla031	Then you should challenge de Pollo directly.
kahpla032	That's a serious charge young man.  What makes you think he's cheating?
kahpla033	Is that all?  Ha!  That's not cheating.
kahpla034	No, organic body oils are perfectly permissible under the rules of the All-World Plank Diving Championship.
kahpla035	Heh, I'm surprised you don't use any.
kahpla036	I am only versed in the subtleties of diving, young one.
kahpla037	May your life be big, and your splashes be small.
kahpla038	You really should be concentrating on your next dive, rather than talking.
kahpla039	Oh, sorry, that trophy is for the winner of the All-World Plank Diving Contest only.
kahpla040	Yes, you've earned that certificate.  Keep it sacred.
kahpla041	Now Marco de Pollo will attempt to beat Guybrush Threepwood's dive.
kahpla042	Marco de Pollo remains the champion!
kahpla043	Sorry, that trophy is for the winner of the diving competition and the winner alone.
kahpla044	Marco de Pollo is about to attempt a...
kahpla045	Keelhaul
kahpla046	Rum Barrel
kahpla047	Spinning Swordsman
kahpla048	Alpha Monkey
kahpla049	combination.
kahpla050	Let's give him complete silence for this dive.
kahpla051	It was our honor, caterpillar.
kahpla052	The Champion Diver may dive whenever he wants.
kahpla053	He has gone where all great athletes go when they've passed their prime.
macpla001	You have shown that you can mimic my moves, Mister Threepwood, but I doubt that you can concoct a dive that I cannot perform!
macpla002	Very well.  The plank is yours.
macpla003	I do not envy you the pummeling you are about to receive.  Nevertheless, the plank is yours.
macpla004	Your skills are improving, but you will never defeat me in a tiebreaker.  Go ahead, prove me wrong.
macpla005	I'm impressed by your pluckiness, but you are starting to annoy me.  Go on, try to make a dive that I cannot match!
macpla006	This is growing tiresome, Mister Threepwood.  You know you cannot defeat me in a tiebreaker,
macpla007	and yet you persist in dragging me through this charade.  Go, make your pitiful dive.  I no longer care.
macpla008	Your arrogance leaves me speechless, Mister Threepwood.  Go on, dive, if that will make you happy.
macpla009	Very good, Mister Threepwood.  Just give me a second to prepare for my dive...
macpla010	Nice dive, Mister Threepwood.  If you'll excuse me for a moment...
macpla011	Not bad, Mister Threepwood.  Please wait here for a moment while I turn off the stove...
macpla012	Now, my friend...prepare to watch a master in action!
macpla013	Good luck, Mister Threepwood.
macpla014	I do not envy you, Mister Threepwood.
macpla015	You really should have stopped while you were behind, Mister Threepwood.
macpla016	I was wrong; I WILL enjoy defeating you again.
macpla017	The plank is yours, Threepwood.
macpla018	What?
macpla019	Shoo!
macpla020	Go away!
macpla021	Aieeee!
macpla022	I...I protest!
macpla023	That was not a fair dive!
macpla024	I want a rematch, right now!
macpla025	I am Marco de Pollo, the greatest plank diver in the WORLD!
macpla026	Who said that?
macpla027	Stop it!  I will not be mocked!
macpla028	Stop it!  Stop it!  Stop it!
macpla029	Arrrrrrrrrr!
macpla030	Thank you, everyone, thank you.
macpla031	Well played, Mister Threepwood.  Feel free to challenge me again in a few years, after you've acquired some skills.
macpla032	Now, Mister Threepwood, if you're done embarrassing yourself, I'm off to gaze at my diving trophies.
macpla033	Have you had enough, Mister Threepwood?
macpla034	I grow weary of your once-charming persistence, Mister Threepwood.
macpla035	Good day, Mister Threepwood.
macpla036	Don't touch that oil!  It's very expensive!
macpla037	I told you not to touch that!
macpla038	So I see.  What can I do for you, Mister Threepwood?
macpla039	Why am I not surprised?
macpla040	Thank you my friend.  I fear that my skills have atrophied as of late, though.  I'm not half the diver I used to be.
macpla041	And who are you, that would take such pains to flatter an aging plank diver?
macpla042	Ah, a pirate.  It's rare to encounter a genuine pirate on Jambalaya Island™ these days.
macpla043	Well, Mister Mighty Pirate, my name is Marco de Pollo, and I am the Greatest Plank Diver in the World!
macpla044	Welcome to Jambalaya Island™, Mister Threepwood.
macpla045	I am Marco de Pollo, undefeated and undisputed Plank Diving Champion of the World!
macpla046	Names are extremely important, young man.  Names can shape one's fate.
macpla047	My name, for example, is Marco de Pollo.
macpla048	It is a name that has unerringly steered me towards my destiny to be the greatest plank diver in the world.
macpla049	I would imagine that your name holds similar portents--
macpla050	-- Or perhaps not.
macpla051	Yes.  I've spent years searching the planet for someone who could better me in the art of the plank dive...
macpla052	but to no avail.
macpla053	Ah, that is an interesting story.
macpla054	About a year ago, I despaired of ever finding my diving equal, and was prepared to hang up my trunks forever.
macpla055	At this crucial moment, Señor Ozzie Mandrill approached me with an intriguing proposition.
macpla056	He told me that he was building the tallest artificial plank-diving platform in the world,
macpla057	and that he was willing to pay obscene amounts of money to have the World's Greatest Plank Diver compete on it on a daily basis.
macpla058	Since I was ready to retire in any event, I figured, why not retire in the comfort of a luxury resort island?
macpla059	Besides, there's always the chance that someone will come along who can finally challenge my skills.
macpla060	Sadly, no.  But at least I'm receiving a steady stream of income.
macpla061	Not until you came along, no.
macpla062	What would I know of such things?
macpla063	Ah, that is a story rife with melancholy.  Are you sure you wish to hear it?
macpla064	Oh no.  Now I'm in it for the thrill of victory and the lure of a fat paycheck.
macpla065	The fact that it provides a temporary balm to my permanent psychological damage is purely a side-benefit.
macpla066	Hardly.
macpla067	If I were to compete against everyone who wanted to get their hands on the solid gold All-World Diving Trophy, I'd be diving twenty-four hours a day.
macpla068	The judges' panel over there does an excellent job of weeding out the poseurs from the serious divers.
macpla069	Mwah-ha-haaa!  Ah!
macpla070	Thank you little friend, for bringing laughter back into my life.
macpla071	Don't tell me you're serious?
macpla072	It's not wise to trifle with me, Mister Threepwood.  I am the Greatest Diver in the World.
macpla073	Very well, the gauntlet has been thrown.  I suppose you have been certified by the Judging Committee?
macpla074	Bah, I've seen palsy-ridden grandmothers with better qualifying scores.
macpla075	But I'm eager to put you in your place.  Prepare to be humiliated, Mister Threepwood.
macpla076	Do you think I am some sort of clown who accepts the challenges of every two-shilling braggart that comes my way?
macpla077	If you want to dive, go to the Judging Committee, and get certified.
macpla078	So, you've managed to get yourself certified?
macpla079	Then you're not ready to face me.
macpla080	Really?  I don't usually allow repeat challenges...
macpla081	...but in this case I'll happily make an exception.
macpla082	Again?  Are you some sort of masochist?
macpla083	Oh, fine.  Just remember, you asked for this humiliation.
macpla084	Oh, come now.  This is becoming pathetic.
macpla085	<Sigh>  All right.  Let's get this over with.
macpla086	Haven't you had enough?
macpla087	<Sigh>  Very well.
macpla088	I never wear hats.  They might screw up the shape of my naturally streamlined head.
macpla089	I'm sorry, but that doesn't ring a bell.
macpla090	Hmm.  How peculiar.  The solid gold All-World Diving Trophy looks like a golden man of some sort.
macpla091	It's over by the judges' table.
macpla092	Perhaps not.
macpla093	It begins with my father, Count Francisco Alvarez de Pollo.  He was a man of peculiar moods and eccentricities.
macpla094	In one of his so-called 'lighter' moments, he named his only son 'Marco,' much to the consternation of his wife and extended family.
macpla095	I take it you have never been in a public swimming pool.
macpla096	Ah, then allow me to elaborate.  At the tender age of six I was sent to my first swimming lesson.
macpla097	Oh, how I happily splashed about, taking to the water like a worm to dirt.
macpla098	Suddenly, someone shouted my name...
macpla099	Marcooo!
macpla100	I turned to see who it was.  Before I could find who had called my name, everyone in the pool shouted in response...
macpla101	Polloooo!
macpla102	I couldn't understand what was happening.
macpla103	WHY were they shouting my name in such an annoying sing-song manner?
macpla104	WHY were they closing their eyes to my obvious torment?
macpla105	I...I tried to get them to stop, but they just kept chanting my name, over and over again...
macpla106	Unable to tolerate it any further, I climbed to the highest diving board in the pool, and cannonballed into the center of the taunting masses.
macpla107	As I hit the water with a resounding ker-splash, the haunting chants of my classmates finally gave way to comforting screams of terror.
macpla108	Yes, but at least I gained a lucrative career out of my childhood trauma.
macpla109	As you wish.
macpla110	You call that a dive?  I can beat that with my eyes closed.
macpla111	Now excuse me for a moment, I must prepare for my dive.
macpla112	You're wasting everyone's time!
macpla113	Hurry up already!
macpla114	Are you going to stand around up there all day!?
macpla115	Quit stalling and dive!
macpla116	You want to dive...against me?
macpla117	Very well.
macpla118	Quit stalling and dive!
macpla119	So, are you challenging me to a dive-off, then?
macpla120	You want to dive...against me?
macpla121	Then prepare to be humiliated, Mister Threepwood.
madl001	How the poop deck should I know?
madl002	I got news for ya, ya grimy son of a bilge; I don't give a rat's barnacled butt.
madl003	Get a load a this guy. Thinks just 'cuz I'm attached to a ship I know where every little two-bit piece of dirt of an island is.  Whatta scupper licker. Ooh, look at meee. I'm Guybrush Threepnard. I'm a mighty STOOPID pirate!
madl004	Look at you, walking around like you've got a bowsprit up your... Hey!  What's this now?
manban001	Hey, where'd he go?
manban002	GET HIM!
manban003	Please speak with the teller.
manban004	Please ask the teller.  I'm very busy, and she can probably assist you.
manban005	You're a Marley?
manban006	Oh... Ah, I see, Mister Marley.
manban007	Well, in that case, talk to the teller, and she'll help you.
manban008	You're not allowed up there!
manban009	Hey!  Don't touch that!
manluc001	Very funny, Mister Threepwood.
manluc002	Are you enjoying the money you stole?
manluc003	Yes, right.  And I'm a 20 karat brooch.
manluc004	Oh, I wish I had a dollar for every time I've heard that.
manluc005	Of course, I used to.
manluc006	Until you came along, that is.
manluc007	Ooh, just great, thanks to you.
manluc008	Now I'm broke, and nobody on this island will trust me with their money ever again.
manluc009	What am I going to do now?
manluc010	What does he look like?
manluc011	Yes, I've seen him, but he didn't have a bag with him.
manluc012	I'M LOOKING AT HIM!
manluc013	Inspector Canard won't let me inside.
manluc014	So, even if I could afford to reopen it, I'm not allowed.
manluc015	That won't help me much, but watching you fall on a sword would be entertaining.
manluc016	I've only met one person who could sell pastries to pirates, and he's in real estate.
manluc017	I'm a banker, I don't know anything about stealing.
manluc018	That's true.  But my health won't buy me a comfortable retirement.
manluc019	The Inspector says that it's a crime scene, and needs to remain sealed until the case is closed.
manluc020	Unlike you, I respect authority and law.  No one will enter the bank until the crime is solved.
manluc021	I didn't rob the bank, if that's what you're insinuating.
manluc022	Maybe.  But all criminals return to the scene of the crime, and here you are.
mblstb001	Yes?
mblstb002	A pirate?  HA HA HA!  I'm a dental hygienist, mister!
mblstb003	Well I'm on vacation, silly!
mblstb004	Danger?  HA!  I laugh at danger!  HA HA HA HA HA!
mblstb005	Besides, I read about how Ozzie Mandrill's been rehabilitating Jambalaya's pirates,
mblstb006	making the island safe for sightseers and cute little shops like this.
mblstb007	Not one.
mblstb008	Isn't that great?
mblstb009	I'd say you were being a big silly!
mblstb010	I'll say!
mblstb011	Somehow I got ripped off!
mblstb012	Some scummy pirate weasel must have swiped my coffee mug from my shopping bag!
mblstb013	Can you believe it?
mblstb014	And this place is supposed to be pirate-free!
mblstb015	Don't get fresh, local boy.
mblstb016	Is that a new kind of frappucino maker?
mblstb017	Ooh.  That sounds exciting!  What do the pieces look like?
mblstb018	Oh my, yes.  What do those pieces look like again?
mblstb019	I'm picking up some bags of this absolutely fabulous StarBuccaneer's™ Coffee.
mblstb020	You just can't get coffee like this at home.
mblstb021	Yeah, but these have 'Jambalaya Island™' stamped on them.
mblstb022	My friends at home will be so envious.
mblstb023	Well of course you do, you poor unsophisticated pirate.
mblstb024	The locals never seem to appreciate what they have.
mblstb025	You bet I did!  My friends'll just die!
mblstb026	What?  Of course not.  Get your own.
mblstb027	Ta.
mblstb028	Ahhh.
mblstb029	You know, I believe the local cliff diving competition has a trophy that looks like that!
mblstb030	I think so.  There was a picture of it in the travel guide.
mblstb031	That's what I remember from the travel guide.
mblstb032	Hmmm.
mblstb033	Nope.  Can't think of anything.
mblstb034	A silver monkey head, huh?
mblstb035	Sorry, I'm drawin' a big ol' blank.
mblstb036	Sounds exotic, though.  If you find the shop that sells 'em, let me know!
mblstb037	Fine.
mblstb038	Oh my word!  Really?
mblstb039	You almost gave me a heart attack!
meamhe001	Who's there?
meamhe002	Go away.
meamhi001	No.  Go away.
meamhi002	Uh, no one.  There's no one here.
meamhi003	Later.  Much later.
meamhi004	Finish running your wife's errands first.
meamhi005	No there isn't.
meamhi006	Uh, yeah.  That.  Well, it's cancelled.
meamhi007	Me, who?
meamhi008	Bye.
meamhi009	There's nobody home.  Now go away.
meamhi010	That ploy won't work.  I know why you're here, and you can't have it.
meamhi011	Ack!  No!  I won't sell!
meamhi012	Go away.
meamhi013	Heh!  Nice try.  Guybrush and Elaine are dead.  I know why you're here, and you can't have it.
meamhi014	Good.  Now go away.
meamhi015	Stop pretending, you greedy old man!
meamhi016	You think you can just buy up the whole island, just because you can insult people?
meamhi017	Well, think again!  You can't take my house away from me if you can't get in!
meamhi018	I knew I shouldn't have fixed that bridge.
meamhi019	Guybrush!
meamhi020	I'd heard you were killed by a giant clam!
meamhi021	What is it, Guybrush?
meamhi022	Like what?
meamhi023	I use them to create me art.
meamhi024	Oh yes.  As a child, I was one of the foremost watercolor painters in the Tri-Island Area.
meamhi025	See, here are me old paint brushes.
meamhi026	I loved painting, but after I lost me hands in...the accident...I just sort of drifted into piracy.
meamhi027	I didn't really like being a pirate, but what else could I do?  I was a painter with no hands!
meamhi028	Well, after me traumatic experience on Monkey Island™...
meamhi029	...I decided that I didn't want to be a pirate no more, and resolved to return to the world of art.
meamhi030	Well, to make a long story short...
meamhi031	One night I discovered that I could create paintings from the wax drippings of colored candles impaled on me hooks.
meamhi032	Since then, I have been known to art-lovers everywhere as 'Meathook -- Master of Wax!'
meamhi033	They're selling like wildfire, which is ironic.
meamhi034	Because if you put 'em next to a wildfire, they melt!
meamhi035	Bwah-ha-ha-haaaaa!
meamhi036	How can I help?
meamhi037	What can I do?
meamhi038	Thanks.
meamhi039	Same way you did, of course.
meamhi040	Herman had a ship?  That jerk never told us!
meamhi041	I guess we didn't escape the same way you did.
meamhi042	I don't want to talk about it.
meamhi043	No.
meamhi044	You mean the BEAST?
meamhi045	Oh, he died.
meamhi046	Loneliness.  A parrot without someone to talk to is a sad parrot.
meamhi047	I don't know what you're talking about.
meamhi048	I still don't know what you're talking about.
meamhi049	What are you talking about?
meamhi050	Ohhh.  You mean this?
meamhi051	Hello, Guybrush!
meamhi052	Sure.
meamhi053	I'm Guybrush Threepwood.  I'm a mighty pirate.
meamhi054	Fine by me.  What DO you want to talk about?
meamhi055	Not to mention celebrated.
meamhi056	Oh, nothing, eh hem.  What brings you to my humble loft, old friend?
meamhi057	No doubt.  What brings you to my little corner of Mêlée, old pal?
meamhi058	Oh, I've gotta get a better agent.
meamhi059	All I get these days are extended cameos.
meamhi060	I've been trying, but it's hard.  I read for a first-person shooter the other day, but the gun kept slipping through me hooks.
meamhi061	I know.  I'm seriously thinking about chucking the whole thing and moving to North Dakota.
meamhi062	But enough of my problems.  What brings you to me humble studio, old chum?
meamhi063	Not a clue.
meamhi064	Maybe you should ask the old Voodoo Lady...she's good with stuff like that.
meamhi065	Nope.
meamhi066	Why?
meamhi067	That's funny.
meamhi068	Many years ago, when I was a child prodigy using conventional watercolors,
meamhi069	Grandpa Marley hired me to paint him a map of the Tri-Island Area.
meamhi070	He said it was going to be a wedding present for his granddaughter.
meamhi071	Unfortunately, he left for Australia before I finished it.
meamhi072	I don't know.
meamhi073	When I began working with wax, I painted over all me old watercolors...
meamhi074	I just couldn't stand looking at them anymore.
meamhi075	I THINK I covered Marley's map with some sort of landscape, that's all I can remember, though.
meamhi076	Oh, no.  My waxy creations are sold faster than I can produce 'em.  Marley's map could be anywhere by now.
meamhi077	It seems likely.
meamhi078	All I know is that it's out there, somewhere, with a beautiful waxy landscape painted over it.
meamhi079	Ha ha!  That's great!
meamhi080	But what happened to me waxy masterpiece?
meamhi081	Grandpa Marley DID tell me that the canvas he gave me to work with was a special 'voodoo' canvas, if that's any help.
meamhi082	Okay.  Anything else?
meamhi083	(grumble)... amateurs...
meamhi084	Get your filthy hands off of me easel!
meamhi085	Only my hands... er... hooks know how to use these tools of artistry!
meamhi086	It IS your backyard.
meamhi087	Don't be silly...those are cans of special colored wax!
megb001	That should take the air out of his soufflé.
megb004	Wow.  Wax really is Meathook's preferred medium.
melu002	Ah. Voila!  Now she should run as good as new! Ehhh?  What's thees? Zhe boats!  Zhey are not moving!  Thees cannot be!
melu003	Oooh! Mon Dieu!
melu005	Ah ha! ...I am Breeeliant! No? She is feexed!...Oh, no... but my beautiful painteeen.  She is ruined!
melu005a	Ah ha! ...I am Breeeliant!  No? She is feexed!...
melu005b	Oh, no... my beautiful painteeen.  She is ruined!
mk1mon001	Ack
mk1mon002	Oop
mk1mon003	Eek
mk1mon004	Chee
mk1mon005	Whoo oooh ooh!
mk1mon006	Eeee Eeee Eeee!
mk1mon007	Ooh ooh ack.
mk2mon001	Ack
mk2mon002	Oop
mk2mon003	Eek
mk2mon004	Chee
mk2mon005	Whoo oooh ooh!
mk2mon006	Eeee Eeee Eeee!
mk2mon007	Ooh ooh ack.
mk3mon001	Ack
mk3mon002	Oop
mk3mon003	Eek
mk3mon004	Chee
mk3mon005	Whoo oooh ooh!  Whooh oooh ooh!
mk3mon006	Whoo Eeee Eeee Eeee Eeee Eeee! Eeee!
mk3mon007	Ooh ooh aah ooh ooh ack.
mk4mon001	Ack
mk4mon002	Oop
mk4mon003	Eek
mk4mon004	Chee
mk4mon005	Whoo oooh ooh!  Whoo oooh ooh!
mk4mon006	Oo Ooo Ooo Eeee Eeee Eeee!
mk4mon007	Ooh ooh ooh ack.
mk4mon008	Eek eek.
mk4mon009	EEEK!  Eep eek!
mk4mon010	Eep?
mtygpt001	Yes?
mtygpt002	A pirate?  Moi?
mtygpt003	Heaven forbid, old bean.  I'm just a humble tourist.
mtygpt004	Normally, you'd be right.
mtygpt005	In the past I've avoided islands like Jambalaya because of their 'pirate problems.'
mtygpt006	But my tour guide assured me that Jambalaya has been scrubbed clean of its more 'undesirable' pirate elements, if you catch my drift.
mtygpt007	You?  Don't be so hard on yourself.
mtygpt008	You may be little <sniff> smelly, and your manners could use some improvement,
mtygpt009	but you're not even one-tenth as vile one of those rapacious brigands that used to roam this island.
mtygpt010	Whatever you say, old chap.
mtygpt011	Isn't it, though?  My wife picked it out for me.
mtygpt012	Is that a fruit-flavored drink over at Planet Threepwood?
mtygpt013	Ooh, a scavenger hunt!  How thrilling!
mtygpt014	Maybe I can help.  What do the pieces look like?
mtygpt015	Absolutely.  My wife tells me I've got a keen mind for such things.
mtygpt016	I'm admiring the craftsmanship of this statue of Jambalaya's most famous pirate:  Tiny LaFeet.
mtygpt017	Nope.  It's absolutely enthralling.
mtygpt018	No bother at all, old bean.
mtygpt019	Hmmm.  Nope.  Nothing comes to mind.
mtygpt020	A bronze pirate hat?  Oh, that's interesting.
mtygpt021	Take a good look at this statue, boyo.
mtygpt022	Well, that'd be my guess.
mtygpt023	A silver monkey head, eh?
mtygpt024	Sorry, I'm drawing a blank.
mtygpt025	Fair enough.
mtygpt026	He was 'The Friendly Pirate of Jambalaya Island™'.
mtygpt027	'He robbed from the bad, and gave to the nice.'
mtygpt028	He's the perfect symbol of the new, non-threatening, Jambalaya Island™.
mtygpt029	Oh, he's real alright.
mtygpt030	I hear his son lives across the bay on Knuttin Atoll.
mtygpt031	I'm not sure.
mtygpt032	Rumor has it that some vandalous pirates from Knuttin Atoll stole the statue's hat.
mtygpt033	But I don't believe it.  They do a pretty good job of keeping those types off of Jambalaya.
mtygpt034	Maybe you're right, but who cares?
mtygpt035	It's the myth of a friendly pirate that's important, not the sordid details of history.
mtygpt036	Fine.
mtygpt037	And he always said please and thank you...twice.
munpta001	Because we don't have a choice?
munpta002	Yikes!
munpta003	Yes?
munpta004	Pirate Spittin' Tobacco, ma'am.
munpta005	Actually, yes.
munpta006	Sorry, ma'am.
munpta007	Yes, ma'am?
munpta008	Yes'm?
munpta009	Darn.
munpta010	Rats.
munpta011	Uh, I don't know how to tell time.
munpta012	I run the attacker through with my trusty sword, Winnie!
munpta013	I, um, make a copy for safe keeping?
munpta014	I...I write a dirty limerick about her on the restroom wall!
munpta015	I send the burger back with a strongly worded comment to the serving wench.
munpta016	I sail by, resisting the urge to attack?
munpta017	I, uh, I make a joke about the expanding size of his grog-belly?
munpta018	I, er, inform the captain of my misgivings, and hope he listens?
munpta019	I, uh, accept the drink, but pour it in a bush when he isn't looking?
munpta020	Dude, that's harsh!
munpta021	Whoah!
munpta022	Ummm Miss Rivers?  Guybrush is scaring me...
munpta023	Ha ha!  That's cool, man!
munpta024	Cripes, you ARE hardcore!
munpta025	Who's Spanky?
munpta026	Jeez, and I thought I was a heartless savage.

murgpt026	Hey, what're you doing?
murgpt027	So that's your game, eh? 'Spin the Helpless Talking Skull' huh?  How juvenile.
murgpt028	Okay, Threepwood, you've had your fun.  Now stop spinning me.
murgpt029	Stop spinning me, accursed mortal!
murgpt030	I said stop it!
murgpt031	If you don't stop spinning me, I'll put an EVIL curse on you!
murgpt032	Okay, here I go, I'm puttin' a curse on you...
murgpt033	That's it, you're cursed.  You are gonna have such a rash.
murgpt034	I am not going to talk to you while you're doing this.
murgpt035	Don't touch me, foolish mortal!
murgpt036	I said, don't touch me!
murgpt037	Mwah ha ha ha!  Not this time, silly mortal!  I'm nailed to the seat of this stool, and there's nothing you can do about it!
murgpt038	Is it a really EVIL liver?
murgpt039	Then I have no use for it!
murgpt040	What makes you think I can't get around the way I am now?!
murgpt041	Foolish mortal!  This is my all-seeing perch which allows me to keep tabs on everything that will soon be under my evil domain!
murgpt042	Well, I would recommend Elaine's Sea-sar Salad... with extra EVIL!!!  Little crunchy evil bits all over it.
murgpt043	MUAHAHAHAHAA!
murgpt044	I don't need a stomach!  I'll devour you all with my EVIL demonic powers!
murgpt045	Get that thing away from me, you twisted freak!
murgpt046	Hmm.. Maybe you're right, hand 'em over.
murgpt047	No, ma'am.
murgpt048	Murray the evil demonic skull would never have a heart!  MUAHAHAHAHAHAA!
murgpt049	MUAHAHHAHAHAA!
murgpt050	Oh, I'm not allowed to drink while I'm on duty.
murgpt051	Evil NEVER sleeps!  MUAHAHAHAHAHA!
murgpt052	MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!
murgpt053	Eww, that's too evil even for me!
murgpt054	Hungry enough to eat your SOUL!  MUAHAHAHAHAHA!
murgpt055	MUAHAHAHAHAH!
murplt001	Guybrush?
murplt002	Guybrush the Mortal Pirate?
murplt003	Welcome to Planet Threepwood, the EVILEST theme restaurant on Earth!  Muahahahaha...
murplt004	Arrr, that's a tale of heart-stopping malice and evil.
murplt005	It all started a few months ago.
murplt006	As usual, I was sitting on my shelf, working on my plans to conquer the world!  Muah-hah-hah-haaaah!
murplt007	Mwah-hah-hah-haaaah!
murplt008	Suddenly the amusement park exploded with a blast of demonic heckfire!
murplt009	After his escape, LeChuck began destroying his theme park in a fit of demonic rage.
murplt010	(Although, personally, I think he was just colossally embarrassed by the whole thing...
murplt011	...I mean really, what kind of a demonically evil scheme involves roller coasters and cotton candy, anyway?)
murplt012	Oh, that.  Well, one of the explosions flung me out to sea, where ironically I landed on the shattered remnants of a midway dart game.
murplt013	After weeks at sea I drifted to shore on this delightfully evil isle, where Ozzie Mandrill
murplt014	(a man after my own blackened soul)
murplt015	gave me a job at this fine establishment.
murplt016	Arrrr.
murplt017	Are you kidding?
murplt018	It had LeChuck, Ozzie, and yours truly...how much more evil can you get?
murplt019	Isn't it obvious?
murplt020	I'm the greeter-slash-bouncer of Planet Threepwood...
murplt021	The creme de la creme in pirate-themed, family-style, altogether EVILLLL dining.
murplt022	All right, I added the 'Evil' part.
murplt023	Why not?
murplt024	Evil needs no arms.  Watch!
murplt025	You, over there!  With the face!
murplt026	Yes, you.  I want you out of the restaurant, now!
murplt027	Talk to the hand, mortal!
murplt028	Don't play smart with me fleshbag!  Out, out, out!
murplt029	Personally, I preferred it when I was just the greeter.
murplt030	It really allowed me plenty of time to work on my evil dreams.
murplt031	But when Floppo the Bouncer Monkey ran away, they needed someone to double on bouncer duty, and I really needed the money.
murplt032	To finance my diabolical schemes, of course!
murplt033	Do you have any idea how much it costs to hire a fleet of Scandinavian barbarians these days?
murplt034	Is it an EVIL talisman?
murplt035	What's it called?
murplt036	The Ultima--
murplt037	Don't be naive, mortal.  The Ultimate Insult is too powerful to be wielded by the likes of you.
murplt038	You fool!  This diagram clearly indicates you need a MONKEY head.  I am a human head.
murplt039	Well, think a little harder.  I want no part of this Ultimate Insult tomfoolery.
murplt040	Absolutely not.
murplt041	I may be evil, but I'm not crazy.
murplt042	Stop by any time for more pirate-themed fun...and EVILLLL!  Mwah-hahahah!
murplt043	No, it was LeChuck!
murplt044	Apparently, his flaming beard melted its way through his icy tomb, freeing him!
murplt045	Oh, he was just letting off a little steam.
murplt046	Steam, get it?  Mwah-hah-ha-hahhhh!  ...I thought it was funny.
navgpt001	Do I be hearing piped-in music wafting through those artificial trees?
navgpt002	I've got repairs to make.
navgpt003	Aye, Cap'n?
navgpt004	Aye, Cap'n.
navgpt005	Oh, maybe later.
navgpt006	Probably not.  This ship's in pretty sorry shape.
navgpt007	Besides, this island makes my skin crawl.
navgpt008	It's...so...clean.
navgpt009	The bitter one with the sword and the attitude?
navgpt010	Oh, she scuppered out of here as soon as we docked.
navgpt011	Well, come to think of it, she DID seem pretty depressed during the whole trip.
navgpt012	Yeah.  Kept muttering about Monkey Island™.
navgpt013	Well, that sounds like good, old-fashioned, pirate-y fun, Captain...
navgpt014	but I really have to repair this wreck of a ship.
navgpt015	Although I'm tempted to just let her sink.
navgpt016	Aye-aye, Capn'.
navgpt017	Ahoy yourself, Captain.  What can I do for ya?
navgpt018	I'm afraid not, sir.
navgpt020	Besides, shouldn't you be lookin' for that Penultimate Inseam dingus?
navgpt029	This old ship is in need of some major fixin' before it goes shovin' off again.
navluc001	There you go, Mister Marley.  Lucre Island™.
navluc002	We can't.  I have more repairs to make.
navluc003	Heh, heh, just kidding.  Ship's ready.
navluc004	Yes?
navluc005	Thanks.  Next time, it 'be helpful if you didn't use the ship's maps as coasters.
navluc006	That useless deck swab?  Beats me.
navluc007	After you left, he ran off.
navluc008	Probably lookin' for new ways to be lazy.
navluc009	She'll be ready long before you get that voodoo anklet removed.
navluc010	Just as soon as I repair the rudder, the mast, and the deck.
navluc011	True.  But it'll still be Threepwood.
navluc012	Whatever you call it, it's still not much of a fashion accessory.
navluc013	I really don't want to hear why you got arrested.
navluc014	Oh, I can see why.
navluc015	Just took a little beating on the way past that breakwater.
navluc016	Nothing I can't fix.
navluc017	Well, it got a bit jolted when we careened off the rocky outcropping.
navluc018	Well somebody scratched 'Help me, Mommy' into it.
navluc019	Deep scratches, but nothing I can't fix.
navluc020	Gee, thanks.
navscu001	Hey!
navscu002	Stay out of the kitchen, ya sissified sea urchin!
navscu003	WHAT?
navscu004	ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR GROG-ADDLED MIND!?  NO!!!
navscu005	DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, BUCKO!
navscu006	I'm open to persuasion...what do you have in mind?
navscu007	Very well.  If you win, I'll be your navigator.
navscu008	Aye...it'll be a pleasure to sail with a refined wit such as yourself.
navscu009	The better to Insult Arm Wrestle with, Mister Threepwood.
navscu010	I thought I'd made myself clear...
navscu011	It's just like Insult Sword Fighting...but with arm wrestling.
navscu012	Aye.
navscu013	If you say so, Mister THREEPWOOD.
navscu014	So does mine.
navscu015	Aye, it'd be my pleasure!
navscu016	Naturally, no discussion of my family would be complete without mentioning my great-great-grandfather...
navscu017	who single-handedly revolutionized the art of roadside carriage wheel repair.
navscu018	Are you daft?  Have ye never heard'a Jack Cheese?
navscu019	Well, there's my great-uncle.
navscu020	He's a renowned holy man who remains steadfastly neutral in any conflict.
navscu021	Ah, so you've heard of him!
navscu022	My brother is starting to make a name for himself.
navscu023	He sings depressing, autobiographical songs.
navscu024	You really know your Cheeses!
navscu025	My great-great-great aunt was legendarily ugly.
navscu026	Well, she was so ugly that men turned to stone at the sight of her.
navscu027	I can't say as I blame you...not too many folk remember Gorgon Zola Cheese.
navscu028	Arr, that doesn't sound too manly.  Any girly-pirate can loot a defenseless fishing community.
navscu029	Pshaw.
navscu030	Sunken treasure hunts are for thieves and scalawags, junior.  Real pirates KEEP their treasure.
navscu031	Sorry, that sounds sort of stupid.
navscu032	Now THAT sounds like a worthy mission for a Mighty Pirate Navigator like meself.
navscu033	Aye.  The seas around Lucre Island™ are very treacherous, and can only be navigated by a skilled sailor.
navscu034	I'd love to face that challenge, but--
navscu035	I can't.
navscu036	Sure, take your time.
navscu037	Because, if I leave my bar for too long, it'll be stolen out from under me!
navscu038	Aye, the one and only.
navscu039	A'listen, skippy, I've got more nerve than a three-legged cat at a dog show!
navscu040	Well, yes, now that you mention it, it is.  But that's not why I can't go, Mister Wisen-pirate
navscu041	I've been fighting off a hostile takeover bid from an Australian land developer.
navscu042	You heard me...
navscu043	A greedy Australian is making a grab for my bar!
navscu044	Worse, with insults, gibes, and mockeries!
navscu045	It's taken all of my Insult Arm Wrestling skill to keep him at bay!
navscu046	Well, it's like this...
navscu047	Don't make me come over there, Driftwood.
navscu048	Whatever.  Anyway...
navscu049	Aye, he was the original owner.  I won the bar from him in an epic, twelve-hour long game of Insult Go Fish.
navscu050	Believe what you like.  In any event...
navscu051	While you were away, the 'Insult Sword Fighting' paradigm became attached to a host of other pirate pastimes.
navscu052	Arr, Ye did.  Fair and square.
navscu053	Ha Ha!  I win!
navscu054	I'm done.
navscu055	Congratulations.  You got yourself a navigator.
navscu056	Hmmm.  That's an interesting proposition, Threepwood.
navscu057	How about this:  If you beat me, I'll be your navigator...
navscu058	But only if you teach me some new insults.
navscu059	Well then...let's see what you've got!
navscu060	Kid, I've been married for thirty years.
navscu061	So, if there's one thing I'm immune to, it's incessant, high pitched, nagging.
navscu062	...high-pitched...
navscu063	...nagging.
navscu064	Well, let me know when you've got one.
navscu065	Yes?
navscu066	Cheese.
navscu067	Ignatius Cheese.
navscu068	And what, pray tell, might I be findin' myself doing if I joined this crew of mighty pirates?
navscu069	Oh, I don't know...what kind of piratin' would I be doin'?
navscu070	Oh, yeah!?
navscu071	NOT.
navscu072	I am rubber, you are glue...
navscu073	I'm shakin'! Ha, ha, oooh... I'm shakin'!
navscu074	Shyea!
navscu075	Oh, how appropriate.  You fight like a cow.
navscu076	You're a big poopie head!
navscu077	You suck!
navscu078	Dummy!
navscu079	Ooh, you're not very nice!
navscu080	Oh, please.  You call THAT an insult?
navscu081	Can't you think of anything better?
navscu082	You're really not trying very hard, are you?
navscu083	<Sigh>
navscu084	Today, by myself, twelve people I've beaten.
navscu085	I've got muscles in places you've never even heard of.
navscu086	Give up now, or I'll crush you like a grape!
navscu087	My ninety-eight year old grandmother has bigger arms than you!
navscu088	I'm going to put your arm in a sling!
navscu089	My stupefying strength will shatter your ulna into a million pieces!
navscu090	Hey, look over there!
navscu091	Your knuckles I'll grind to a splintery paste.
navscu092	Your arms are no bigger than fleas that I've met!
navscu093	People consider my fists lethal weapons!
navscu094	Only once have I met such a coward!
navscu095	You're the ugliest creature I've ever seen in my life.
navscu096	My forearms have been mistaken for tree trunks!
navscu097	I've out-wrestled octopuses with these arms!
navscu098	Do I see quivers of agony dance on your lip?
navscu099	From the size of your gut, I'd guess they were eaten.
navscu100	It's too bad none of them are in your arms.
navscu101	I would if it would stop your WINE-ING.
navscu102	Yeah, but we've both got better bladder control than you do.
navscu103	Why, are you studying to be a nurse?
navscu104	I'm surprised you can count that high!
navscu105	Yes, yes, I know: it's a three headed monkey.
navscu106	Ungh... I thought that the bean dip had strange taste.
navscu107	Oh... So THAT'S why you're scratching... I'd go see a vet.
navscu108	Sadly, your breath should be equally reckoned.
navscu109	He must have taught you everything you know.
navscu110	Well I'm shocked that you never 'ave gazed at your wife.
navscu111	An over-the-counter defoliant could help with that problem.
navscu112	I'm sure that spineless creatures everywhere are humbled by your might.
navscu113	It's laughter that's caused by your feathery grip.
navscu114	Har!  I win!
navscu115	Come back later, when you're feeling up to the challenge.
navscu116	Well nowadays, you can't throw a dart or play a game of checkers without being expected to toss in a withering bon mot.
navscu117	My particular specialty is Insult Arm Wrestling, which I use to defend my bar from hostile takeovers.
navscu118	Nay.
navscu119	You're out of touch, Mister Marley.
navscu120	I said...
navshi001	It doesn't look very seaworthy.
navshi002	Aye, Cap'n.
navshi003	Hey.  If anyone here gets to go to the SCUMM Bar... it's me.
navshi004	Aye.
navshi005	Ahoy.
navshi006	Quiet.   Too quiet.
navshi007	She's on scupper cleanin' duty.
navshi008	I was witness.  He beat ye fair and square.
navshi009	Oh, she and Otis played a round of Insult Rock, Paper, Scissors to see who would have to clean the scuppers.
navshi010	She lost.
navshi011	That's what I tried to tell that Australian jerk, but it didn't work for me, either.
navshi012	Oh, he's around here somewhere.
navshi013	I told him not to leave the shipyards.
navshi014	What might that be?
navshi015	Now what!?
navshi016	Why not?
navshi017	Yeah, for another two whole acts.
navshi018	What?
navshi019	Hmm.. how about that.
navshi020	Are you kidding?  That was foreshadowed from the start.
navshi021	It wouldn't have anything to do with being beaten in Insult Arm Wrestling by a spaghetti-armed pirate-wannabe, would it?
navshi022	Then I don't know nuthin' about it.
navshi023	I think I might want to have her start fighting all of my Insult Arm Wrestling matches for me.
navshi024	Work?  Is that what you call it?
navshi025	That's what I like to hear.
navshi026	Har!  That happens all the time.  The good salty sea breeze actually helps freshen the air inside a bit.
navshi027	That's a good one, Threepwood.
navshi028	I think I would've heard something if THAT happened.
navshi029	What!?  That Australian land developer finally got his hooks on it!?
navshi030	I KNEW that would happen if I left town!
navshi031	How so?
navshi032	aAAAgh!
navshi033	Aye.
navtri001	Nonsense, Captain.  A little rain never hurt anyone.
navtri002	Ah-haaaaaa!
navtri003	Batten down the hatches!
navtri004	Clear the scuppers!
navtri005	Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war!
navtri006	Oh, the ship canna stand the strain, Cap'n!
navtri007	Arrrr, where'd be the fun in that, Captain?
nedscu001	Hey!  Get out of the way!
nedscu002	No problem.
nedscu003	Ha!  That's easy!
nedscu004	Ooh, trying to be tricky, huh?
nedscu005	Watch the master at work.
nedscu006	Here goes nothing.
nedscu007	Wow, that's pretty good.
nedscu008	Nice shot.
nedscu009	I'm impressed.
nedscu010	Hey, you're pretty good.
nedscu011	Impressive.
nedscu012	Hmmmmmmrrrr...
nedscu013	Yeah!  Can't ya see we're busy here?
nedscu014	Yeah, and unless you're good enough to compete--
nedscu015	We'd advise that you take a long walk off a short pier.
nedscu016	Really?
nedscu017	No.
nedscu018	Yeah, we never miss a shot.
nedscu019	Name it, and I'll hit it.
nedscu020	I would, but once I win the Mêlée Championship, I'm going to have to go on tour to win the 'Tri-Island Dart Thrower's Championship'.
nedscu021	Says you, swabbie.
nedscu022	Nah.
nedscu023	Right now we're in a dead tie.
nedscu024	But not by much.
nedscu025	Me.
nedscu026	Are you still here?
nedscu027	...
nedscu028	Oops.
nedscu029	You better.
nocd001	Hold still, you.
nocd004	Quiet, you!
nocd005	Well, I'll be...eh let's see that screw.
nocd007	Quiet, you!  Well, alright then, I guess your name has been cleared.
nocd008	Let's see that leg of yours.
nocd010	Hold on.  Maybe I should do a background check on you.  Just because you didn't rob the bank doesn't mean that you aren't wanted for other, more heinous crimes.
nocd010a	Hold on.  Maybe I should do a background check on you.
nocd010b	Just because you didn't rob the bank
nocd010c	doesn't mean that you aren't wanted for other, more heinous crimes.
nocd013	Quiet, you!
nocd014	On the other hand, without the stigma of felonious robbery hanging over your head, you seem pretty harmless, so, off you go!
nocd014a	On the other hand, without the stigma of felonious robbery hanging over your head,
nocd014b	you seem pretty harmless, so, off you go!
nogb002	If the nose fits, you must acquit!
nogb009	Oh. Um. Right, ha, the anklet thingy.
nogb012	Quiet, you!
nogb015	Hey, was that an insult?
nopp002a	Argh! Daa!
nopp003	It doesn't fit!
nopp006	I've never seen that screw before in my life!
nopp011	Hey! He stole a duck!
nopp016	Yah....ugh...ah...ugh...yara..ugh.
opemig001	Ha ha ha ha ha... Who's afraid of a sea cow?
opemig002	Well, if it isn't the bucking buccaneer!
opemig003	Come back to give the old cow another run?
opemig004	Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
opemig005	If it isn't the master of the mechanical manatee!
opemig006	Welcome to the finest micro-groggery in town!
opemig007	Come on in and enjoy some hand-crafted homebrewed grog!
opemig008	Careful there!  Don't want to scare the customers!
opemig009	Okay, I'm going to start at the 'Bed-Wetter' setting, which shouldn't be any trouble for a stout young guy like you.
opemig010	Ready?
opemig011	Hahahah!  It looks like the ol' sea cow got the best of you!
opemig012	Hahahah!  Ya see, the trick is to stay ON the manatee!
opemig013	Hahahah!  I've seen drunk old ladies who were able to hold on tighter than that!
opemig014	Ha ha ha ha ha ha... bed wetter... heh, heh.
opemig015	Not bad!  Okay, now let's increase the difficulty until we get to the top setting!
opemig016	WooHOO!  Ride'em seacowboy!
opemig017	Almost...
opemig018	3...
opemig019	2...
opemig020	1...
opemig021	YOU DID IT!
opemig022	I thought we'd lose you on the 'Grazing Frenzy' setting, but you made it!
opemig023	You've joined an elite fraternity, my friend.
opemig024	Not many have survived their rides on the savage manatee.
opemig025	Come on over to the bar, partner, and I'll get you your Monkey Mug Meal Coupon!
opemig026	Here ya go!  Enjoy your prize!
opemig027	Howdy!  What can I do ya for?
opemig028	You got some ID?
opemig029	Well, then I can't give you the good stuff...
opemig030	But I can give you this new low-inebriation grog-like beverage.
opemig031	It's called 'Grog Jr.'™.
opemig032	We developed it here in our micro-groggery, for people just like yourself.
opemig033	It's got just enough alcohol in it to stun a skinny parrot!
opemig034	Here, try some and tell me what you think.
opemig035	Sorry, no.  Only one promotional free cup per customer.
opemig036	It's great!
opemig037	This is the only place in the entire Tri-Island Area that people can come and get gourmet freshly-distilled grog.
opemig038	People come from all over to sample our sixty-five different variations of grog and grog by-products!
opemig039	These include Snoot Groggy Grog, Green Grog, Dangerous Dark, Siren's Urine (named for its color, not contents), and of course our award winning Stale Ale!
opemig040	Every grog we have is distilled lovingly and individually by members of the MicroGrogger family.
opemig041	What are you, some kind of unsophisticated hick?
opemig042	That, my friend, is the Menacing Mechanical Manatee!
opemig043	It's called the Menacing Mechanical Manatee.
opemig044	Well, the inhabitants of this island (in conjunction with Ozzie Mandrill Enterprises) have worked very hard to keep this island friendly and clean and family-compliant.
opemig045	Yeah.  We don't have much use for those surly, ragamuffin pirate types around here.  They're not very good role models.
opemig046	You sound surprised.  Say, you're not one of those scruffy undesirable pirates that are always scarin' little kids, are ya?
opemig047	Well, good for you!
opemig048	You too.
opemig049	The manatee is a marine mammal that grazes on sea grass and other plant life in shallow waters.
opemig050	They are typically 9 to 10 feet long, and weigh about 1000 pounds.
opemig051	Oh?  Well, you try to snatch the grass out of a manatee's mouth and see how menacing it gets.
opemig052	Well, mostly for entertainment.
opemig053	But as a promotional special, we're currently giving away a Planet Threepwood coupon for a complimentary Monkey Mug Meal to anybody who can ride the Manatee at the highest setting.
opemig054	Normally you pay a copper coin to ride it for fun.
opemig055	But currently, we're running a promotional special where you can get a Planet Threepwood coupon for a complimentary silver monkey mug if you are pirate enough to ride it on the highest setting.
opemig056	All righty!  Let's see whatcha got!
opemig057	Sorry, you've already won a Monkey Mug Meal coupon, and we only hand out one prize per customer.
opemig058	Okay.
opemig059	Woohoo!  You did it!
otigpt001	NO cushy government job is worth this much grief.
otigpt002	And tacky theme restaurants.
otigpt003	I'll stay here and, um, uh, guard the ship.
otigpt004	What?
otigpt005	Oh yeah, THAT'LL be easy...
otihoj001	I'm a victim of society!
otihoj002	How did you know!?
otihoj003	Some old guy with a weird accent accused me of stealing flowers from his front yard!
otihoj004	Hey, just because my captain is a notorious bank robber, there's no reason to take it out on me!
otihoj005	Yes?
otihoj006	It's a plot, I tell you!
otihoj007	People are to make me seem less fearsome and piratey by accusing me of being the kind of pirate who likes to pick flowers.
otihoj008	Aww, go pick a pack of poseys.
otihoj009	Would it help if I gave you a breath mint?
otihoj010	Like where the bank loot is hidden?
otihoj011	Nope.
otihoj012	But he has revealed his award-winning recipe for Narwhal Ricotta.  Hee hee!
otihoj013	Don't knock it until you tried it.
otihoj014	You're gonna get me out of here, right?
otihoj015	What?
otihoj016	She's on shore leave.
otihoj017	I'm sure you can find her at the bottom of a bottle of grog.
otihoj018	I wish I could join her.
otihoj019	Good for her!
otihoj020	Because someone has to stay and watch the ship,
otihoj021	while, uh, Mister 'There's Plenty of Room Between Those Reefs' Hot-Shot Navigator fixes the damage he did to the hull.
otihoj022	It's just as well...this whole island give me the creeps.
otihoj023	I don't know...I can't imagine needing anything from a town that's so...clean.
otihoj024	Are you kidding?  I'm living the Ultimate Insult.
otihoj025	How much trouble could I get into walking on a dock?
otihoj026	Besides, I'm not sure I WANT to go into town...this island gives me the willies.
otihoj027	That's what I was trying to do.
otihoj028	No thanks...I try not to drink anything with a longer name than mine.
otihoj029	Yes, very much.
otihoj030	I don't trust those micro-groggeries.
otihoj031	I've never seen a pirate go blind drinka micro-grog.  Now you tell me...
otihoj032	What kind of grog is that?
otihoj033	Don't I get enough of you in my life as it is?
otihoj034	Ha freakin' Ha.
otiluc001	Oh no.  There's not going to be a next time is there?
otiluc002	Oh sure.  I see how it is.  The captain gets to make all the decisions.
otiluc003	Thank Gods!  I hate this repressive place!
otimel001	This contract has not even been signed by the Governor!
otimel002	Wait a minute!  This is a standard government MANUAL LABOR contract, with no pension plan or dental coverage!
otimel003	Come back when you got something that doesn't involve back-breaking labor.
otimel004	Why are you showing us this?
otimel005	Um, Carla, do you even know what half of this stuff means?
otimel006	Well, all right then!
otimel007	We got some heavy-duty begging to attend to.
otimel008	Yeeps!
otimel009	Oh, ah, sorry 'bout that, heh heh.
otimel010	Yeah, that's it... uh, startled, heh.
otimel011	Oh, definitely.  Can't swing a dead Chinook around here without hitting someone who look like us.
otimel012	Doesn't everyone know the name of Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate?
otimel013	Ah, where to begin?
otimel014	HOLY JUMPING MOTHER OF GOD, NO!
otimel015	Nooooooooo.
otimel016	...monkeys...monkeys...it's full of the monkeys...
otimel017	Ooooh.
otimel018	The horror...the horror...
otimel019	Ooooh.
otimel020	>-Snort-<
otimel021	Carla, what are you doing?
otimel022	Don't listen to him, Carla...he just wants to take us back to Monkey Island™!
otimel023	Oye, icky!
otimel024	And never in the summers!
otimel025	Apparently.
otimel026	CARLA, MAKE THE BAD MAN STOP!  HE'S COME TO TAKE US BACK TO MONKEY ISLAND™!
otimel027	I don't know what you're talking about.
otimel028	The crew you abandoned on Monkey Island™, you mean!
otimel029	Yeah!
otimel030	Scarred us for life.
otimel031	Well, after I FINALLY escaped from Monkey Island™...
otimel032	I made my way back to Mêlée Island™, where I tried to resume my former profession.
otimel033	I prefer to think of it as 'pro-active redistribution of wealth.'
otimel034	Unfortunately, the indignities I suffer on Monkey Island™ have left me so jittery...
otimel035	...that I cannot pick a lock or a pocket without making more noise than a flatulent hippo.
otimel036	Begging, mostly.
otimel037	You'd be amazed how many people will pay to hear the story of 'The Innocent Pirates Who Were Betrayed By Their Idiot Captain'.
otimel038	But he didn't want to!
otimel039	Smirk was so ashamed that he signed over the deed to his house on the spot, and hopped the next ship out of Mêlée.
otimel040	Haven't you noticed all the 'Sold' signs around here?
otimel041	That's a good question.
otimel042	That's what we said!
otimel043	No!
otishi001	Is THAT the ship?
otishi002	No.
otishi003	Fine, let's get this over with.
otishi004	It'll all end in tears, mark my words.
otishi005	Yeah, you guys.  Stay here while, uh, Guybrush and I check out the flora.
otishi006	We were?
otishi007	Oh great.  Now where are we goings?
otishi008	Oh, hi Guybrush.
otishi009	Who's what?
otitri001	Aiiieeee!
otitri002	Rig for silent running!
otitri003	Drain the bilges!
otitri004	My turn to drive!
otitri005	Monkeys, monkeys, monkeys!
otitri006	This was only supposed to be a three-hour tour!
ozel004	No!
ozel006	NO!
ozel008	You...big...jerk!
ozel013	Ha! Well, I guess Grandpa was too smart for you diabolical dodos after all!
ozel016	Grrr.
ozel018	That? Oh, that's nothing. Just a piece of junk I bought on my honeymoon ...
ozel036	Noooo!
ozel040	Oh Ozzieee...
ozel048	Guybrush!  Look out for-
ozel049	- the Ultimate Insult.
ozel052	Really?
ozel059	Guybrush?
ozel061	Am I the only one seeing a giant walking statue of LeChuck on our front lawn?
ozel064	Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!
ozel065a	 
ozel066	Eeeeek!
ozel068	Guybrush, help!
ozel070	Guybrush, don't you dare leave me!
ozel084	Granmpa?
ozgb001	That's one giant step for man, one tiny flick of a switch for a giant monkey robot.
ozgb041	You two stay here and guard the robot!
ozgb047	Honey, I'm home!
ozgb051	Somehow, I always knew it would end like this.
ozgb055	Let's get outta here!
ozgb060	Yes?
ozgb062	Um, no.
ozgb063	Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!
ozgb065a	 
ozgb065b	(Panting)
ozgb067	Elaine!
ozgb069	Hang on, I'll be right back!
ozgb078	C'mon guys, we've got to get this Giant Monkey Robot moving, NOW!
ozgb080	Actually. That's kind of a funny story...
ozgb083	It was a present...from H.T. Marley!
ozhn043	Try not to break any of my stuff!
ozhn044	Nice kid, but about as sharp as a soggy pancake, y'know what I mean?
ozhn077a	Ugh...Ugh...
ozhn077b	Ugh...Ugh...Ugh...
ozhn077c	Ooh!
ozhn079	Where's my granddaughter?
ozhn085	I'm in here, dear!
ozjj042	Good luck!
ozjj045	Tell me about it.
ozjj088	Now is your undoing, evil one.
ozjj089	Now is the time foretold in the ancient prophecies of Monkey Island™.  Now is the time for the ultimate in...
ozjj089a	Now is the time foretold in the ancient prophecies of Monkey Island™.
ozjj089b	Now is the time for the ultimate in...
ozjj090	MONKEY KOMBAAAAAAAT!
ozlc009a	Aargh.
ozlc009b	Uuugh....ergh.
ozlc009c	Argh...ugh...eegh....oh.
ozlc009d	Argh!
ozlc009e	Ugh....eegh.
ozlc009f	Aigh...agh.
ozlc010	Blast!
ozlc012	I'll tell ya what's wrong!  This so-called 'Ultimate Insult' doesn't work!  I've tried whacking it against every piece of junk in this accursed hovel, but nothing happens!
ozlc012a	I'll tell ya what's wrong!  This so-called 'Ultimate Insult' doesn't work!
ozlc012b	I've tried whacking it against every piece of junk in this accursed hovel,
ozlc012c	but nothing happens!
ozlc015	Grrr.
ozlc019	Arrrr, the Gubernatorial Seal of Mêlée Island™.  Of course!
ozlc032	Oh, let me use it on Elaine!  With her spirit broken she'll finally consent to be my bride!
ozlc032a	Oh, let me use it on Elaine!
ozlc034	Ah ha ha ha. Aye, you're a sadist after my own blackened lump of a heart, Mandrill.
ozlc038	Arrrr, I KNEW this ridiculous plan would never succeed. I guess this just goes to show that you should never send an Australian girly-man to do the work of a real pirate.
ozlc038a	Arrrr, I KNEW this ridiculous plan would never succeed.
ozlc038b	I guess this just goes to show that you should never send an Australian girly-man
ozlc038c	to do the work of a real pirate.
ozlc046	I'll show that chum bucket pantywaist some REAL voodoo!
ozlc058	Arrrr, ye be looking like ants from up here!
ozlc071	Don't worry, my beloved. Guybrush isn't going anywhere!
ozlc073	You insignificant mortal flea!  How dare you wield your pathetic voodoo magiks against the immortal might of the Demon Pirate LeChuck!  I'll grind yer bones to make me grog, ya triple...timin'... bastich!
ozlc073a	You insignificant mortal flea!  How dare you wield your
ozlc073b	pathetic voodoo magiks against the immortal might of the Demon Pirate LeChuck!
ozlc073c	I'll grind yer bones to make me grog, ya triple...timin'... bastich!
ozlc075	How may I serve you, master?
ozoz002	So ya see...
ozoz003	...It was I who enticed the mysteries of the Ultimate Insult out of your drunken sot of a grandfather!
ozoz005	It was I who sabotaged the ship!
ozoz007	And it was I who sent him to a watery grave off the coast of Australia!
ozoz011	What's wrong, you reanimated lump of voodoo flotsam?
ozoz014	Grrr.
ozoz017	What in the name of Adam Smith's invisible hand is that?
ozoz020	Let me see that.
ozoz021	Well, that's seems to have shaved the proverbial dingo. Let's test this bugger out. Ah, Pegnose?
ozoz021a	Well, that's seems to have shaved the proverbial dingo.
ozoz021b	Let's test this bugger out. Ah, Pegnose?
ozoz023	Would you be so good as to stand over there?
ozoz025	Or what?
ozoz027	You were saying?
ozoz029	Take a long walk off a short pier, you craven wretch.
ozoz031	Well, Mrs. Threepwood, it seems as though the power of the Ultimate Insult is finally mine! Heh heh.
ozoz031a	Well, Mrs. Threepwood,
ozoz031b	it seems as though the power of the Ultimate Insult is finally mine!  Heh heh.
ozoz033	All in due time, Captain. But first, let's give her a taste of things to come by destroying the egos of all her pirate friends!
ozoz033a	All in due time, Captain.  But first,
ozoz033b	let's give her a taste of things to come.
ozoz035	For years, the Caribbean has been buffeted by the unpredictable winds of runaway piracy. Now, by the power of the Ultimate Insult, I hereby banish those chaotic tempests, and usher in a new age of orderly consumerism! Ha! I am Ozzie Mandrill: Look upon my works, ye mighty pirates, and despair!!! Ha!
ozoz035a	For years, the Caribbean has been buffeted by the
ozoz035b	unpredictable winds of runaway piracy.
ozoz035c	Now, by the power of the Ultimate Insult, I hereby banish those chaotic tempests,
ozoz035d	and usher in a new age of orderly consumerism! Ha!  I am Ozzie Mandrill:
ozoz035e	Look upon my works, ye mighty pirates, and despair!!!  Ha!
ozoz037	Where's the kaboom? There's supposed to be a Caribbean-shattering kaboom! Work, damn your eyes, work!
ozoz037a	Where's the kaboom?  There's supposed to be a Caribbean-shattering kaboom!
ozoz037b	Work, damn your eyes, work!
ozoz039	LeChuck! Get back here and help me fix this thing!
ozoz047a	Uuugh....ahhhh....ungh...uuungh...omph.
ozoz047b	Ugh!
ozoz047c	Aaagh!
ozoz047d	Agh!
ozoz050	I don't how you dimwits managed to sabotage my magnificent Insult Amplification Apparatus, but I'll at least have the satisfaction of annihilating your arrogant pirate souls!
ozoz050a	I don't how you dimwits managed to sabotage
ozoz050b	my magnificent Insult Amplification Apparatus,
ozoz050c	but I'll at least have the satisfaction of annihilating your arrogant pirate souls!
ozoz053	Prepare to meet your doom, Threepwoods!
ozoz054	What the didgeridoo is that?
ozoz056	You won't escape that easy, ya swashbuckling ninnies!
ozoz057	Great Barrier Reef!
ozoz065	Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!
ozoz065a	Yaaah!
ozoz071a	Yah!
ozoz071b	Yaah!
ozoz071c	Uugh!
ozoz072	Let go of me, you rock-brained monstrosity!
ozoz074	Oh, shut up.
ozoz076	Well, eventually, I'll be wanting you to squish every pirate on the face of the planet into a sticky red goo, but for now, let's just...KILL GUYBRUSH THREEPWOOD!
ozoz076a	Well, eventually, I'll be wanting you to squish every pirate on the face
ozoz076b	of the planet into a sticky red goo, but for now, let's just...
ozoz076c	KILL GUYBRUSH THREEPWOOD!
ozoz077	After him!
ozoz081	THREEPWOOD!
ozoz082	Where did ya find that ridiculous-looking contraption?
ozoz086	Well, what an unexpected family reunion! Too bad I have to ruin it by savaging your puny minds with the power of the Ultimate Insult!
ozoz086a	Well, what an unexpected family reunion!
ozoz086b	Too bad I have to ruin it by savaging your puny minds
ozoz086c	with the power of the Ultimate Insult!
ozoz087	Now what?
ozpp009	Quiet, you!
ozpp022	What?
ozpp024	Look, Mister 'High-And-Mighty' Mandrill, I'm getting awfully tired of following orders. I think it's about time we renegotiated the terms o' my employment.
ozpp024a	Look, Mister 'High-And-Mighty' Mandrill,
ozpp024b	I'm getting awfully tired of following orders.
ozpp024c	I think it's about time we renegotiated the terms o' my employment.
ozpp026	Or I'll fill yer belly full of lead, ya sissified fossil!  No one messes with Pegnose the Pirate and lives to tell the tale!  I'll rip off your arms and I'll beat ya---
ozpp026a	Or I'll fill yer belly full of lead, ya sissified fossil!
ozpp026b	No one messes with Pegnose the Pirate and lives to tell the tale!
ozpp026c	I'll rip off your arms and I'll beat ya---
ozpp028	Please, please don't hurt me, Mister Mandrill!  I'll do whatever you say from now on, I promise!
ozpp028a	Please, please don't hurt me, Mister Mandrill!
ozpp028b	I'll do whatever you say from now on, I promise!
ozpp030	Right-o, sir!
ozzban001	... and just why not, young lady?
ozzban002	But you've honored them countless times before!
ozzban003	That's a kangaroo, you ignorant pirate trollop!
ozzban004	Ah, struth!
ozzban005	I've got business to attend to, but I'll come back, and when I do, I want these honored!!!
ozzhos001	Freddie!  Where's my new walking stick?
ozzhos002	It'd better be, or I'll buy up your putrid little shop and replace it with something useful...
ozzhos003	Like a public urinal!
ozzhos004	What do you think?
ozzhos005	Freddie!  My new cane 'ad better be ready!
ozzhos006	Creepwood?  Thinkin' of buying a walking stick of your own are ya?
ozzhos007	Heh, might make you look more distinguished, heh heh.
ozzhos008	Quite like a monkey in a hat, heh.
ozzhos009	Put it on my bill, Freddie.  And don't even think about over-charging me, or I'll own ya!
ozzlag001	I must have kangaroos in me upper paddock.
ozzlag002	This Ultimate Insult nonsense has me uncharacteristically baffled.
ozzlag003	I knew I should have taken that class on Ancient Voodoo Curses at the University of Toowoomba.
ozzmon001	Ack
ozzmon002	Oop
ozzmon003	Eek
ozzmon004	Chee
ozzoze001	Still here, are ya?
ozzoze002	You'll pay, Threepwood.
ozzoze003	That trip to town is getting' to be a nuisance.  
ozzoze004	I may have a short temper, but I've got a lot of walking sticks!
ozzozi001	And when I return, I'll have plumbed the mysteries of the Ultimate Insult!
ozzozi002	With the power of the Ultimate Insult, the Caribbean will be mine!
ozzozi003	Don't touch anything while I'm gone.
ozzozi004	NO!  I just had that one deodorized!
ozzozi005	That's it!  Get out!
ozzozi006	Hey!
ozzozi007	Who are you, and what are you doing in my house?
ozzozi008	Fine.  And if I win, you have to leave my house.
ozzozi009	Let's stick to the basics, shall we?
ozzozi010	En garde!  Touché!
ozzozi011	Naturally.  Now get outta my house!
ozzozi012	Of course ya lost.  I'm unbeatable.  Now leave!
ozzozi013	Haven't ya been paying attention?  I NEVER lose.  Now beat it!
ozzozi014	NO!  I just had that one deodorized!
ozzozi015	What are ya doing!?
ozzozi016	And what is that horrid smell?
ozzozi017	Stop that!
ozzozi018	What is that horrid smell?
ozzozi019	Ugh, there's that smell again!
ozzozi020	You've befouled my crocodile!
ozzozi021	You've befouled my platypus!
ozzozi022	You've befouled my wombat!
ozzozi023	You've befouled my koala!
ozzozi024	You've befouled my dingo!
ozzozi025	You've befouled my kangaroo!
ozzozi026	You've befouled my ostrich!
ozzozi027	Oh crikey!  Look what ya made me do!
ozzozi028	Now I need to order a new cane!
ozzozi029	Ow, I think that hurt.
ozzozi030	I've no idea what you just said, but I feel strangely insulted.
ozzozi031	I'm a what what a what what?
ozzozi032	I can't argue with that.
ozzozi033	I'm sure that was a stinging insult, but I don't know why.
ozzozi034	Well, didgeridoo to you, too!
ozzozi035	What was that part in the middle about the thing?
ozzozi036	What the heck are you saying!?
ozzozi037	That's not an insult!  Is it?
ozzozi038	Right back at ya!
ozzozi039	Uuummm uh...
ozzozi040	Oh yeah!?
ozzozi041	Every enemy I've met I've annihilated!
ozzozi042	I've defeated twelve people today, alone!
ozzozi043	This is the END for you, you gutter-crawling cur!
ozzozi044	Would ya like to be buried or cremated?
ozzozi045	Give up now, or I'll crush you like a grape!
ozzozi046	Soon you'll be wearing my sword like a shish kebab!
ozzozi047	You can't match my witty repartee.
ozzozi048	You fight like a dairy farmer!
ozzozi049	My sword is famous all over the Caribbean!
ozzozi050	Killing you would be justifiable homicide.
ozzozi051	Your mother was a hamster!
ozzozi052	I usually see people like you passed-out on tavern floors.
ozzozi053	I'm gunna put your arm in a sling!
ozzozi054	You have the sex appeal of a Shar-Pei.
ozzozi055	You have the manners of a beggar.
ozzozi056	Hey, look over there!
ozzozi057	I'll give you a choice.  You can be gutted, or decapitated!
ozzozi058	I've spoken with apes more polite then you.
ozzozi059	I've seen fleas with bigger arms than yours!
ozzozi060	Nothing on this earth can save your sorry hide!
ozzozi061	Your mother wears a toupee!
ozzozi062	I hope you got a boat ready for a quick escape.
ozzozi063	When your father first saw you, he must have been mortified.
ozzozi064	Only once have I met such a coward!
ozzozi065	You're as repulsive as a monkey in a negligee.
ozzozi066	With your breath, I'm sure they all suffocated.
ozzozi067	How do you know?  You don't have that many fingers!
ozzozi068	I've got a little TIP for you, get the POINT?
ozzozi069	With you around, I'd prefer to be fumigated.
ozzozi070	Your mommy'll have to peel me, first!
ozzozi071	First you better stop waving it like a feather-duster.
ozzozi072	I could, if you'd use some breath spray.  Ugh.
ozzozi073	How appropriate.  You fight like a cow.
ozzozi074	Too bad no one's ever heard of YOU!
ozzozi075	Then killing you must be justifiable fungicide.
ozzozi076	Your father smelt of elderberries!
ozzozi077	Even BEFORE they smell your breath?
ozzozi078	Why? Are you studying to be a nurse?
ozzozi079	I look THAT much like your fiancée?
ozzozi080	I wanted to make sure you'd feel comfortable with me.
ozzozi081	Yes, yes, I know, it's a three headed monkey.
ozzozi082	I'm glad to hear you attended your family reunion.
ozzozi083	THAT's why you've been scratching so furiously!
ozzozi084	The only way you'll be preserved is in formaldehyde.
ozzozi085	Oh, that is so cliché!
ozzozi086	Why, did ya wanna borrow one?
ozzozi087	At least mine can be identified.
ozzozi088	He must have taught you everything ya know!
ozzozi089	Bugger off to Bullamanka!
ozzozi090	You're a snag short of a barbie!
ozzozi091	I've seen better mugs on a bush pig.
ozzozi092	You got kangaroos in the top paddock.
ozzozi093	You wouldn't know Christmas from Bourke Street.
ozzozi094	When I'm done with you, you'll wish you had barcoo rot.
ozzozi095	Looks like things are crook in Musellbrook for you.
ozzozi096	You're not the full quid!
ozzozi097	You're more daggy than a mate from Whoop Whoop.
ozzozi098	I've seen better from a bludger.
ozzozi099	You've seen one too many smacks from the Illywhacker.
ozzozi100	You're driving me berko.
ozzozi101	You smell worse than a dunny budgie.
ozzozi102	Don't come the raw prawn with me!
ozzozi103	When I'm through with you, you'll flog the cat.
ozzozi104	No need to act the goat.
ozzozi105	You're not within cooee of beating me!
ozzozi106	I'm as cunning as a dunny rat!
ozzozi107	I'm gonna give you a gobful!
ozzozi108	It's London to a brick that you're gonna lose.
ozzozi109	You're not worth a zack!
ozzozi110	Ha Haaa!
ozzozi111	Not bloody likely.
ozzozi112	Ha-ha!  You're even weaker than you look.
ozzozi113	What do ya want now?
ozzozi114	Because I'm a man with a vision.
ozzozi115	I see a Caribbean freed from the chaotic plundering of grog-swilling pirates...
ozzozi116	...a Caribbean made safe for the orderly consumerism of family-oriented theme restaurants and resorts...
ozzozi117	...a Caribbean scrubbed clean of filth...
ozzozi118	...a Caribbean you'd be proud to take home to your mother.
ozzozi119	I thought I made it clear:
ozzozi120	The Caribbean is infected by the disease known as piracy...
ozzozi121	I intend to cure it with some old-fashioned Australian capitalism.
ozzozi122	Well, for one thing, pirates smell.
ozzozi123	The only thing that smells worse than a pirate is two pirates.
ozzozi124	It's enough to make a man park a tiger on the rug.
ozzozi125	Not much.
ozzozi126	Other than the fact that they're an uncouth subculture of illiterate yobbos...
ozzozi127	who make it impossible for a hard working businessman to earn an honest quid
ozzozi128	without worrying about being sacked and/or pillaged?
ozzozi129	Not much, really.
ozzozi130	I like having them around.  They remind me of where I came from.
ozzozi131	Australia, ya ninny!
ozzozi132	That's strange...I heard that YOU were the one who robbed the bank.
ozzozi133	What?
ozzozi134	Ha!
ozzozi135	Your puny pirate brain is incapable of perceiving the true depths of my 'scheme.'
ozzozi136	Besides, you'll never be able to pin anything on me without the loot.
ozzozi137	And you'll NEVER find it.
ozzozi138	Really?  You found Pegnose's Booty Showcase?
ozzozi139	What did it look like?
ozzozi140	Let me guess.  You found Pegnose's Booty Showcase.
ozzozi141	And what did it look like?
ozzozi142	'Pretty Good?'
ozzozi143	Listen, kiddiewink, I'll have you know that my insults have finished off over 500 hostile takeovers.
ozzozi144	There isn't a man alive or dead who can withstand the might of my withering barbs.
ozzozi145	Oh, really?  And what stakes do you propose?
ozzozi146	If you must.
ozzozi147	What would you like to play for?
ozzozi148	Not too soon, I hope.
ozzozi149	My name is Ozzie...
ozzozi150	Ozzie Mandrill.
ozzozi151	A pirate!?  I hate pirates!
ozzozi152	For a zillionaire, you look a LOT like a smelly pirate!
ozzozi153	You can't fool me, Mister Threepwood.
ozzozi154	It's common knowledge that there aren't any monkeys in the Caribbean.
ozzozi155	I think you're a scungy pirate.
ozzozi156	Don't make me laugh.
ozzozi157	You're just another maggoty pirate.
ozzozi158	Don't play the gink with me, Threepwood.
ozzozi159	Well then, allow me to illuminate the dingy corners of your mind.
ozzozi160	Ozzie Mandrill is a businessman.  A capitalist.  A real estate developer.  I'm also...
ozzozi161	...the future King of the Caribbean!
ozzozi162	Bwah-ha-ha-haaaah!
ozzozi163	The SCUMM Bar?  That's just the tip of the aardvark!
ozzozi164	I'm going to buy the whole Caribbean!
ozzozi165	Oh, that'll be retrained.
ozzozi166	Yes.  The service-based economies of tomorrow's Caribbean will need legions of waiters, janitors, maids, and dishwashers.  Heh heh.
ozzozi167	What makes you think they'll have a choice?  Heh heh heh.
ozzozi168	They'll be torn down, of course.
ozzozi169	No more will these islands be cursed with the blight of run-down watering holes, murky voodoo shops, and disease-ridden houses of ill repute.
ozzozi170	Instead, our streets will be decorated with classy art houses, whimsical theme restaurants, and upscale knick-knack shops.
ozzozi171	Ah, they always sell out...
ozzozi172	...eventually.  Heh.
ozzozi173	What about 'em?
ozzozi174	And I'm tired of discussing them.
ozzozi175	Maybe you're not as stupid as ya look.
ozzozi176	Hmmm.
ozzozi177	You're probably bluffing...
ozzozi178	...but I was planning to take a hike to the showroom anyway.
ozzozi179	That's a lamer bluff than the last one.
ozzozi180	But I suppose another squiz at the Marley Heirlooms wouldn't hurt.
ozzozi181	Ahhh.
ozzozi182	Your bluffs are more transparent than Lacepede Bay.
ozzozi183	Lucky for you I still haven't divined the secrets of the Ultimate Insult from the Marley Heirlooms.
ozzozi184	Maybe I think you're bluffing.
ozzozi185	I said...
ozzozi186	Would you mind not harassing my animals?
ozzpph001	Ahh, all in due time, my dear Mister Pegnose...
ozzpph002	We've only completed part of the plan.
ozzpph003	You've done an admirable job in getting Guybrush out of the way,
ozzpph004	as well as reappropriating the Marley family heirlooms.
ozzpph005	I trust you've put them somewhere safe for the time being?
ozzpph006	That 'junk', as you call it, may very well be the key to ridding these islands of pirates once and for all.
ozzpph007	No offense, of course.
ozzpph008	Later, my good man.  In the meantime, the heirlooms are our little secret.
ozzpph009	Keep them hidden, and not a word to anyone.  We'd hate to have my plans spoiled by an indiscretion.
ozzpph010	There's no need to be such a ruffian.  You'll get what's coming to ya.
ozzpph011	I'm off to tend to my affairs.  Now that we're in possession of the Marley heirlooms, I must begin determining how they relate to the Ultimate Insult.

pegban001	So long, suckers!
pegban002	And remember, you've just been robbed by Guybrush Threepwood!  Har, har, ha!
peghoj001	It won't prove a thing!
peghoj002	GRRAH!  Let me out of here!
peghoj003	You've got nothin' on me!
peghoj004	Ha!  That won't hold up as evidence.
peghoj005	Hey, I resent that!  I'm not slimy!  I took a bath last month!
peghoj006	Because I'm innocent!
peghoj007	Yeah, what he said!
peghoj008	I'm innocent!
peghoj009	You ain't got nuthin' on me!
peghoj010	What do you want, you pony-tailed freak?
peghoj011	Oh leave me alone.  Being incarcerated is bad enough without the torture of your drivel.
peghoj012	Oh no, not you again.
peghoj013	You're nothing without your precious attack duck!
peghoj014	I don't know what you're talking about.
peghoj015	Oooh, now THERE'S a threat.
peghoj016	Or what?
peghoj017	I'll never talk.
peghoj018	I don't know who or what yer talkin' about!
peghoj019	And you still can't figure it out.  You're a sorry excuse for a pirate.
peghoj020	A, ha, ha, ha, right.  I'll let you get back to running errands for the wifey!
peghoj021	I'm not talkin' to you!
peghoj022	Aaaah!
peghoj023	Are you getting more dates now that you've discovered a better scent?
peghoj024	Well, I still have drainage, you know.
peghoj025	Hey, that's cruel and unusual punishment!
peghoj026	Freedom?!  You can't even leave the island!
peghoj027	Ha!
peghoj028	Ha, there's no pets allowed in this building!
peghoj029	I've had worse.
peghoj030	Big talk for a such little man!
peghoj031	That doesn't surprise me.
peghoj032	Yeah?  Then I'll sing show tunes through me nose cavity!
peghoj033	That's what I figured.
pegpph001	Aaack!
pegpph002	Go away you stupid duck!
pegpph003	Get out of here!  Fly south like the rest of them!
pegpph004	Stop tormenting me, you dumb bird!
pegpph005	My house is not an aviary!!!
pegpph006	Shoo!  Before I brain ya!
pegpph007	No!  I don't have any duck food!
pegpph008	Where are all these ducks coming from?
pegpph009	... like I said, I got the job done, now where's my money?!
pegpph010	Of course, I have!  I'm no idiot.
pegpph011	That junk you're so interested in is safe and sound in my impenetrable cave.
pegpph012	Right.  So about my fee...
pegpph013	All right, Mister Mandrill.  We'll do it your way.  But if you don't pay me soon, I'll cut yer gizzard out!
pegpph014	I'd better.
pegpph015	YEEEAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!!
pegpph016	Get away from me, you crazy duck!
pegpph017	Gaaah!
pegpph018	WhhoooooooOAAAA!!!
pegpph019	LET ME OUTTA HERE!!!
pegvau001	Nobody move!
pegvau002	Nobody leaves until I get all the loot and safe passage outta here!
pegvau003	Down on the floor!
pegvau004	Everybody freeze!  This is a robbery!
pegvau005	I said don't move!
pegvau006	I'm Guybrush Threepwood.
pegvau007	That's G U Y B R U S H... uh, T H R E E P W O O D.
pegvau008	I want all of it!
pegvau009	And don't forget the loot behind the counter!
pegvau010	I'll never give up!
pegvau011	My lawyers are fired!
pegvau012	You'll never get me, Guybrush Threepwood, coppers!
pegvau013	Don't even try it, punk!
pegvau014	Don't be a hero!
pegvau015	Never!
pegvau016	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty bank robber!
pegvau017	There's only one criminal more nefarious than me, and that's Pegnose Pete!
pegvau018	No!  Forget the vault.  Just give me everything else!
pegvau019	Top o' the world, Ma!

preluc001	Welcome to Scents and Sensibilities,
preluc002	Where subtle--
preluc003	-Ahem-
preluc004	Where subtle fragrances from exotic lands transport you to worlds of romance and delight.
preluc005	My name is Hugo, and I am a licensed aromatherapist.
preluc006	Can Hugo interest you in one of our fine perfumes, colognes, or after-shaves?
preluc007	Hugo's not a pirate, Hugo's a model citizen, making a positive economic contribution to the economic well-being of Lucre Island™.
preluc008	But Hugo's not a pirate.  Not anymore, leastways.
preluc009	By taking Ozzie Mandrill's Pirate Re-Education Mail Order Correspondence Course.
preluc010	It's a miracle, it is.  In three weeks it taught Hugo how to channel his destructive antisocial urges into more constructive avenues.
preluc011	Precisely.
preluc012	Because Hugo could read the writing on the wall.
preluc013	Hugo saw that the pirate lifestyle was being marginalized by powerful outside interests.
preluc014	Hugo decided to get out while the getting was good.
preluc015	Not especially, no.
preluc016	...Although sometimes Hugo misses the wind in his face...
preluc017	...and the wenches...
preluc018	And Hugo misses the grog...
preluc019	...and the decks covered with the blood of Hugo's enemies... <sigh>
preluc020	But other than that, no, not a thing.
preluc021	No, but Hugo did see YOU run by here with a sack of loot.
preluc022	Towards the deepest forests of Lucre Island™.
preluc023	That's our featured fragrance, Eau de LeChuck.
preluc024	Oh, it's very popular among tourists wanting to capture that authentic 'swashbuckling' mystique.
preluc025	We prefer to refer to it as 'Earthy.'
preluc026	Oh yes, sir.  In the last few hours Hugo's gone through dozens of sample bottles.
preluc027	Thank you for your patronage.  Please come again.
preluc028	Yes, that is L'eau de la fleur, the perfect perfume for the most feminine of ladies...
preluc029	Or the least masculine of males.
preluc030	Tis the smell of the sea in a bottle!
preluc031	Oh yes, a breakthrough in scent technology.
preluc032	This is called 'Mutt', a well adjusted combination of every essence known to pirate man!
preluc033	Oh that's new 'Candycane' perfume.
preluc034	It smells nice... AND it's EDIBLE!
pricol001	Please keep all hands and arms inside the vehicle at all times.
pricol002	Permanascan sentados, por favor.
pricol003	Don't worry if your feet begin tingling...that just means it's working.
pricol004	I hope this isn't the boat with the leak.  A heh heh.
pricol005	If the boat gets stuck, just give it a good kick!
pricol006	You know, you're our first human test subject.
pricol007	At this point I'd usually say something about the joys of marriage, but since you're already married, I can skip that part.
pricol008	How was the ride?
pricol009	In other words, a perfect metaphor for marriage.
pricol010	Please step out of the boat to your right, and enjoy your visit to the First Church of LeChuck (Orthodox).
pricol012	Yes, my child?
pricol013	Greetings, my child.
pricol014	Welcome to the First Church of LeChuck, Orthodox.
pricol015	I am Father Allegro Rasputin.  How may I help you?
pricol016	Not at all.  This temple is dedicated to worshipping the awe-inspiring perfection that IS LeChuck.
pricol017	I kindly suggest that you mind your tongue, heretic.
pricol018	Such blasphemies will not be tolerated in the House of LeChuck.
pricol019	They're remarkably alike,
pricol020	only ours has a lot more screaming, flames, and pointy sticks.
pricol021	Yes, I know.  We use it for church ceremonies.
pricol022	Good question, tovarisch.  Here at the Church of LeChuck, we see marriage as a plunge into the unknown.
pricol023	As a symbol of that plunge, we send our newlyweds on a harrowing ride down a river of molten lava.
pricol024	Only if the restless Spirit of LeChuck doesn't approve of the union.
pricol025	Besides, our honeymoon boats are lined with StanTech Voodoo-Enhanced Asbestos, to keep fatalities to an acceptable minimum.
pricol026	Wonderful!
pricol027	Where is your bride?
pricol028	Well, then, you can't take the plunge.
pricol029	Welllll, I suppose we could use another test run before LeChuck and Elaine's impending nuptials.
pricol030	Hop on board!
pricol031	This is highly unorthodox, but...
pricol032	What the heck!
pricol033	Ah, yes, the prophesized wedding of noble LeChuck and the chaste Elaine.
pricol034	All the signs point towards the prophesy being fulfilled any day now.
pricol035	I've been working my ghost fingers to the bone trying to get the church ready for their wedding ceremony.
pricol036	The First Church of LeChuck (Orthodox) doesn't recognize Elaine's blasphemous marriage to the...Anti-LeChuck.
pricol037	The evil Anti-LeChuck.  'He-Whose-Name- Must-Not-Be-Spoken.'
pricol038	Ack, you said the name!  Blasphemer!
pricol039	Hahahaha.  Don't be silly.
pricol040	The Anti-LeChuck is three meters tall, has a prehensile tail, a forked tongue, and the number '1138' stamped on his forehead.
pricol041	Stop saying that name!
pricol042	Of course not.  I'm a ghost.
pricol043	Da.
pricol044	Hahahaha.  Very clever, my child.  But let's not go looking for trouble, eh?
pricol045	That's an interesting story, tovarisch...
pricol046	Many years ago, I was the captain of a stately ship called The Weeping Iguana.
pricol047	It was a good life, hauling contraband plush toys from one island to another.
pricol048	And then I met LeChuck.
pricol049	His crew of crazed ghost pirates made quick work of my fine ship and her equally-fine crew.
pricol050	LeChuck himself gutted me with his flaming ghost sword, and held my still-beating pancreas in front of my face before I died.
pricol051	When I woke up, I was another member of his obedient ghost crew.
pricol052	It was a gradual process.
pricol053	At first I resented LeChuck for turning me into a ghost.
pricol054	But the more I thought about it, the more I came to revere him as a god.
pricol055	After all, he did bring me back from the dead, which is a pretty neat trick.
pricol056	So I decided to build this church in his honor.
pricol057	The hours are good, but I occasionally miss the high seas.
pricol058	What's troubling you, my son?
pricol059	Das Vedanya.
pricol060	There is no Escape from Monkey Island™.
pricol061	Well then, why don't you just escape it again, Mister Smarty-Pants?
pricol062	Ha!
pricol063	Like I said, there is no Escape from Monkey Island™.
pricol064	Not even in the sweet embrace of death.
pricol065	I've never heard of that.  What is it?
pricol066	Hmmm.  During my travels with LeChuck, I noticed that the easiest way to defeat a voodoo curse was by employing a BIGGER voodoo curse.
pricol067	But perhaps I'm oversimplifying your plight.
pricol068	Think big, tovarisch.
pricol069	You must do as LeChuck does when beset by many enemies at once, my son.
pricol070	No, you must turn your enemies' energies against themselves.
pricol071	How should I know?  I'm just a ghost.
pricol072	As you wish.
pricol073	Weddings.
ptwgpt001	Knock it off, Murray!
ptwgpt002	Murray!  I hope you're not planning on wearing those horrible guts.
ptwplt001	Knock it off, Murray!
ptwplt002	Murray!
ptwplt003	Hi, I'm Elayne, and I'll be your waitress this afternoon.
ptwplt004	Would like to hear about today's special?
ptwplt005	We call it Stan's Budget Baloney Sub.
ptwplt006	It's four pieces of baloney, ham, and turkey, smothered in three types of cheese, on rye bread.
ptwplt007	Ha, that's funny, we've been getting that reaction all day.
ptwplt008	This is Planet Threepwood, one of a chain of restaurants dedicated to showcasing the exploits of the Tri-Island Area's most famous pirate:  Guybrush Threepwood!
ptwplt009	Excuse me?
ptwplt010	Heh heh.  That's a good one, sir.
ptwplt011	Everyone knows that Guybrush Threepwood is about 6 foot 4, has a scar about yea long over his left eye, and has a big black parrot!
ptwplt012	Okay, what are your parents' names?
ptwplt013	I'm Elaine Marley, the Pirate Princess of Mêlée Island™!
ptwplt014	What?
ptwplt015	Planet Threepwood is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ozzie Mandrill Enterprises.
ptwplt016	What'll it be?
ptwplt017	Whatever gave you that idea?
ptwplt018	Gasp!
ptwplt019	Uh, th...that's not me!
ptwplt020	It's NOT me.  Understand?
ptwplt021	I've never heard of that.  Is it on the menu?
ptwplt022	If it's not on the menu, then we don't make it.
ptwplt023	Let me know when you're ready to order.
ptwplt024	Then maybe you aren't really Guybrush Threepwood.
ptwplt025	Ha!
ptwplt026	Everyone knows their names were Fred and Ginger.
ptwplt027	Everyone knows their names were Harry and Carrie.
ptwplt028	Everyone knows their names were Dwayne and Bertha.
ptwplt029	Huh?
ptwplt030	Everyone knows their names were Fredo and Moonbeam.
ptwplt031	How adventurous.
ptwplt032	And to drink?
ptwplt033	I thought it might.
ptwplt034	Ka-Ching!
ptwplt035	Very good sir.
ptwplt036	-Sigh-
ptwplt037	It's all on the menu.
ptwplt038	Call me after you've read it.
ptwplt039	Good choice, sir.
ptwplt040	And how will you be paying?
ptwplt041	A popular choice, sir.
ptwplt042	And how will you be paying?
ptwplt043	Fine.
ptwplt044	Let me know when you're ready.
ptwplt045	This place wouldn't exist if it weren't for Ozzie Mandrill, sir.
ptwplt046	And you don't look like him.
ptwplt047	In any event, don't bother me again until you have some way of paying for your meal.
ptwplt048	We don't run tabs at Planet Threepwood.
ptwplt049	There are still too many deadbeat pirates hanging around to start handing out lines of credit.
ptwplt050	You know the type.
ptwplt051	Ahhh, let me know when you've got some way to pay for a meal.
ptwplt052	I thought not.  Listen buster, things are pretty busy around here.  Don't bother me again until you're ready to pay for your meal.
ptwplt053	Listen, buster, things are pretty busy around here.
ptwplt054	Don't bother me again until you're ready to pay for your meal.
ptwplt055	Very good, sir.
ptwplt056	I'll bring out your food and your ceremonial Mega Monkey Mug in few minutes.
ptwplt057	No thanks, I'm perky enough as it is.
ptwplt058	HEY HEY!  Look but don't touch!
ptwplt059	Sorry, the bar is closed right now.  Come back later.
ptwplt060	Hey Hey!  That complimentary monkey mug MEAL doesn't come with a complimentary Monkey MUG!
ptwplt061	Excuse me sir, but you're not allowed to keep the Monkey Mug.
ptwplt062	Sir, please return the Monkey Mug.
ptwplt063	I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to relinquish the Monkey Mug.  You're not allowed to keep it.
ptwplt064	Hold it right there buster.  You're not leaving with that Monkey Mug.
ptwplt065	I'll be right with ya.
ptwplt066	Have a seat.
ptwplt067	Seat yourself.
ptwplt068	Are you finished?
ptwplt069	Can I clear your place, now?
ptwplt070	Please note that, due to the unexpectedly high demand, we are no longer providing the entree portion of the meal for coupon-bearing customers.
ptwplt071	However, you will still receive your complimentary beverage in the ceremonial Monkey Mug.
rivcpt001	What can I do for you, young man?
rivcpt002	Are you ready to take our class, young man?
rivcpt003	This isn't your average school, dearie.
rivcpt004	This is the Ozzie Mandrill Pirate Transmogrification Center.
rivcpt005	Transmogrification.
rivcpt006	We take barbaric, foul-smelling pirates
rivcpt007	(like yourself)
rivcpt008	and transform them into prim, productive, and polite members of the emerging consumer-based economy.
rivcpt009	Oh, now, now, sweetie.  Don't knock it until you've tried it.
rivcpt010	Wonderful!  Just go in and take a seat, and you'll soon be on your way to a brighter tomorrow.
rivcpt011	What's that?
rivcpt012	Oh my, we don't allow any voodoo paraphernalia in our classroom, young man.
rivcpt013	Mister Mandrill feels that voodoo is a prime contributor to the pirate lifestyle.
rivcpt014	Do you mean that brave Admiral Casaba?
rivcpt015	He's single-handedly keeping the great unwashed pirate masses of Knuttin Atoll from corrupting the paradise of Jambalaya Island™.
rivcpt016	The most courageous men are always a little crazy, dearie.
rivcpt017	Yes, Mister Threepwood?
rivcpt018	Well, what for, dearie?  You already passed the class.
rivcpt019	Oh, you poor man.  Take a seat, and we'll get started.
rivcpt020	Are you prepared to take the class seriously this time?
rivcpt021	I understand.  Take a seat, and we'll get started.
rivcpt022	Absolutely not!
rivcpt023	I have no intention of wasting my precious skills on intractable pirates like you...
rivcpt024	Not while there are pirates out there who are practically begging for this service.
rivcpt025	Go away, Mister Threepwood.
rivcpt026	You have to pass the course to get a certificate, Mister Threepwood.
rivcpt027	But I didn't confiscate anything from you, sweetie.
rivcpt028	Sorry, dear, but the owners of confiscated items must reclaim them in person.
rivcpt029	And watch the mouth, sonny.
rivcpt030	Don't try to smooth talk me, mister.
rivcpt031	Aaahhh fire!  Everyone run for your lives!
rivcpt032	Aah, another fire!  Everyone run for your lives!
rivcpt033	Alrighty, I've had just about enough of this tomfoolery.
rivcpt034	There's going to be some sore fannies when I catch the person responsible for this swashbuckling delinquency.
rivcpt035	Grrr.
rivcpt036	Now now, young man.  That fire alarm is only to be used in case of an emergency.
rivpta001	Welcome back, class.
rivpta002	I can see that all of you have been here before, so let's cut to the final exam, shall we?
rivpta003	Three questions, one hundred percent of your grade...
rivpta004	Good afternoon, class.
rivpta005	My name is Miss Rivers, and I'd like to welcome you to Ozzie Mandrill's Pirate Transmogrification Academy,
rivpta006	a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ozzie Mandrill Enterprises.
rivpta007	Just by walking in that door, you've already taken a courageous first step in a journey...
rivpta008	A journey that will transform you from 'swashbuckling' pirates into healthy...
rivpta009	...normal...
rivpta010	..and most of all, PRODUCTIVE members of society.
rivpta011	And why have you made this step?
rivpta012	No, dear...you've come here BECAUSE YOU'RE SCUMSUCKING PIRATES WHO DESERVE TO BE DRAGGED INTO THE STREET AND SHOT LIKE THE DOGS YOU ARE!!!
rivpta013	Now then, for the next few hours we'll be breaking down your anti-social pirate defense mechanisms,
rivpta014	and replacing them with more acceptable, marketable, behavioral traits...
rivpta015	First, let's have a frank talk about pillaging...
rivpta016	Very nice, Yangja.
rivpta017	Now class, let's move along to your final exam...
rivpta018	Three questions that will account for ninety percent of your grade.
rivpta019	Don't get smart with me, sonny.
rivpta020	Let's begin.  Yangja?
rivpta021	Now then, Guybrush...
rivpta022	Now, Mungle...
rivpta023	What's in your mouth, young man?
rivpta024	Did you bring enough for everyone?
rivpta025	Well, that's hardly the point, young man.  We don't allow pirate paraphernalia in this classroom.
rivpta026	Hand it to me.
rivpta027	Now then, Mungle...
rivpta028	Okay.  Second question...
rivpta029	Guybrush...
rivpta030	Mungle...
rivpta031	And Yangja...
rivpta032	Alrighty then.  Now for the third and final question...
rivpta033	Now, Yangja...
rivpta034	And, finally, Mister Threepwood...
rivpta035	Well, I've added up all your scores, and I must say that I'm very unhappy.
rivpta036	Mungle, I'm afraid you didn't pass.
rivpta037	Your heart's in the right place, dear, but your brain is somewhere cold and dark and covered with spiders.
rivpta038	Yangja, I'm flunking you, too.
rivpta039	Yes, dear, but your attitude sucks.
rivpta040	So's life, sweetie.  Get used to it.
rivpta041	Mungle and Yangja, I'm afraid you've failed again.
rivpta042	And then we have Guybrush...
rivpta043	Guybrush, I'm proud to say that you're the best student that Ozzie Mandrill's Pirate Transmogrification Academy has ever had!
rivpta044	It's an honor to bestow upon you this Certificate of Transmogrification, which will help you get a high paying job in the tourist services industry!
rivpta045	Now, before you all leave to continue your lives, I just have one more thing to say...
rivpta046	GET OUT!
rivpta047	Guybrush, you've renewed your Certificate of Transmogrification with flying colors, congratulations.
rivpta048	NOW GET OUT!
rivpta049	Guybrush, I'm afraid you didn't pass, either.
rivpta050	Don't despair, though.  Many of our finest graduates had to take this course five or six times before they fully transmogrified.
rivpta051	No, I just didn't want you to feel bad.
rivpta052	Now, I'd like to leave you with these words of encouragement...
rivpta053	GET OUT!
rivpta054	Guybrush, I'm afraid you still didn't pass.  Keep trying, though.
rivpta055	Guybrush, Guybrush, Guybrush...
rivpta056	I've been teaching this course for months, and I can safely say...
rivpta057	THAT YOU'RE THE SINGLE WORST STUDENT I'VE EVER MET!  I'VE PICKED LINT OUT OF MY BELLY BUTTON WITH MORE LEARNING POTENTIAL THAN YOU!
rivpta058	Now, in order to guarantee that you NEVER darken my school's doorstep again, and to stigmatize you for the rest of your hopefully-short life,
rivpta059	I'm strapping this dunce cap to your stubborn pirate head, in the hopes that humiliation will succeed where education failed.
rivpta060	NOW GET OUT OF MY CLASSROOM, AND NEVER RETURN!
rivpta061	A stranger approaches you and asks for the time.  How do you respond?
rivpta062	You see a man accosting another with a sword.  What do you do?
rivpta063	While reading a book of poetry in the library, what appears to be a treasure map falls out of the book.  What's your plan of action?
rivpta064	A member of the opposite sex rebuffs your advances.  How do you cope?
rivpta065	Your tofu burger is delivered medium well, despite your explicit request for medium rare. How do you react?
rivpta066	While delivering Christmas toys to orphans on a nearby island, you notice a passing ship that's obviously taken on too much cargo.  What do you do?
rivpta067	After drinking too much grog, a friend of twenty years teases you about your haircut.  What is your reaction?
rivpta068	Your captain has plotted a course directly through the heart of the Devil's Triangle.  How do you react?
rivpta069	A scruffy-looking stranger offers you a grog.  What's your response?
rivpta070	Mmm-hmmm.
rivpta071	Ahhh.
rivpta072	I see.
rivpta073	Hmmmm.
rivpta074	Interesting.
rivpta075	Okay.
rivpta076	Good.
rivpta077	Oh dear.
rivpta078	My heavens!
rivpta079	Yikes!
rivpta080	Jumpin' Jehosephat!
rivpta081	Oh, my!
rivpta082	Goodness gracious!
rivpta083	Well, I never!
rivpta084	Oooh, no, that won't do.
rivpta085	Yumpin' Yiminy!
rivpta086	Now, that's just rude, Mister Threepwood.
rivpta087	I'm shocked to see how you've reverted to your former, nasty pirate ways.
rivpta088	Perhaps you should re-enroll to brush up on your skills.
rivpta089	But for now, I think you should...
rivpta090	If you can't wait until the end of the exam, then you'll fail.
rivpta091	Aha!
rivpta092	Gotcha!
rivpta093	Not so fast, buster!
rivpta094	Thought you could pull a fast one on me, eh?
rivpta095	Think you're pretty clever, don't you?
rivpta096	The fire alarm is not a toy, Mister Threepwood!
rivpta097	GET OUT!
rivpta098	Uh uh uh, Mister Threepwood...we don't want to touch the nasty old pirate toys, do we?
rivpta099	Mister Threepwood...I told you NOT to touch those.
rivpta100	Don't make me come over there, Mister Threepwood.
rivpta101	Watch your mouth, young man!
rivpta102	Oh, that certificate doesn't mean anything anymore.  I've voided your transmogrification.
rivpta103	You'll never amount to anything, even WITH that certificate!
rivpta104	Hmmph.
rivpta105	Oh, hello there Mister Peepwood.
rivpta106	How have you been faring since your re-education?
rivpta107	Oh heavens!  You sound like you need a refresher course.
sb1scu001	Hey!  fradda fruddah frzz...
sb1scu002	Razzaprazz.
sb1scu004	Wrdp.
sb1scu005	Uh, plstx.

sbcstb001	Iced groggoccino half caff!
sbcstb002	Iced groggoccino with lemon!
sbcstb003	Decaf deluxe mocha impresso!
sbcstb004	Super charged triple caff heart resuscitator special!
sbcstb005	Groggoccino Valencia!
sbcstb006	Plain black coffee!
sbcstb007	Grog Machiado!
sbcstb008	Tea!
sbcstb009	Frozen Latte Blizzard!
sbcstb010	Um, sir, I'm not sure what you're doing, but I'm sure it's against company policy.
sbcstb011	HEY!  The tough pirate look is out.  My job prospects are better as a friendly, non-threatening, corporate lackey.
sbcstb012	Someday I will manage one of these stores.
sbcstb013	Yes, but you'd still be on Mêlée Island™.
sbcstb014	Welcome to StarBuccaneer's™ Coffee House.
sbcstb015	Can I help you, sir?
sbcstb016	Sorry, sir, but we don't serve straight grog here.
sbcstb017	But we do have some nice grog-flavored coffee drinks to choose from.
sbcstb018	Excellent.  We have many fine drinks to choose from.
sbcstb019	Very good, sir!  You almost sound like a real pirate!
sbcstb020	Can I make you a coffee drink?
sbcstb021	Have a nice day, and visit us again soon.
sbcstb022	You'll have to go over to the micro-groggery for that, sir.
sbcstb023	We prefer not to compete with independent businesses.
sbcstb024	It's a synthetic grog substitute.  Quite good, really.
sbcstb025	That would be our iced groggoccino.
sbcstb026	Grog flavored coffee beans, ground up over ice.  Very refreshing!
sbcstb027	No, sir, I'm afraid we only serve coffee drinks here.
sbcstb028	We wouldn't want to compete with the other stores in the area.
sbcstb029	Whatever you say, sir.  What else can I do for you?
sbcstb030	Our featured coffee is the iced groggoccino.
sbcstb031	That would be our iced groggoccino.
sbcstb032	Then what can I do for you?
sbcstb033	You betcha, sir.  I'll take care of that for you.
sbcstb034	Excellent choice, sir.  One iced groggoccino, 350 Jambalaya Bucks.
sbcstb035	Oooh, well, I'm sorry, then, sir.  It's well worth it, though.  We're offering free refills with every purchase.
sbcstb036	Predatory practices aren't good for anyone except the consumer.
sbcstb037	Instead of having a one stop shop that offers a single bland choice for every item you may want...
sbcstb038	...we prefer to specialize and give our customers literally hundreds of confusing options.
sbcstb039	It's the company credo.  We have to learn it before we earn the right to wear the StarBuccaneer's™ apron.
sbcstb040	Why, yes.  You'd be surprised how many washouts we get.
sbcstb041	Now, what can I get for you?
sbcstb042	Here at StarBuccaneer's™, we care less about the needs of the consumer, and more about the relationship we have with our competitors.
sbcstb043	That's the beautiful part.  Because we have these agreements, there are no other coffee houses.
sbcstb044	So, if you want a coffee drink, this is the place!
sbcstb045	Me too!  Watch this!
sbcstb046	Arrrrrgh!
sbcstb047	Pretty good, huh?  I was top in my class at the Pirate Training Academy.
sbcstb048	So, pirate-boy, what can I get for ya?
sbcstb049	Sure they do!  Sitting down with a latte to discuss piratey things with their pirate friends is a pirate tradition!
sbcstb050	Perhaps you're hanging out with the wrong crowd.  All the young hip pirates are drinking coffee drinks now.
sbcstb051	Can I make you our most popular drink, the iced groggoccino?
sbcstb052	Good.
sbcstb053	Can't get enough of my sweet coffee goodness, can ya?
sbcstb054	All righty.  Coming right up.
sbcstb055	I think you've been hitting the funky bean too hard there, sir.
sbcstb056	Your cup is still full!
sbcstb057	Hey, wait a minute.  Ya... you know you have to pay for those, right?
sbcstb058	A wonderfully delightful blend of artificial cream cheese and salmon lox bits with the convenience of a spray-on can!
sbcstb059	We're giving away free samples today as a promotion, so please help yourself.
sbcstb060	That 'goop' you are referring to is StarBuccaneer's™ own Schmear Whiz™!
sbcstb061	That delicious mini-bagel you're about to sample has StarBuccaneer's™ own Schmear Whiz™ on it.
sbcstb062	That's a souvenir mug, not a coffee cup.
sgoall001	We're using it to time our match.
sgoall002	We're using that.
sgoall003	We need it to keep track of the time.
sgoall004	Um, no, don't touch that.
sgoall005	I wouldn't recommend touching that.
sgoall006	Patience, pirate-boy.
sgoall007	Without the clock, this game would go on forever.
sgoluc001	That doesn't count!
sgoluc002	But, but, but...
sgoluc003	Fine.
sgoluc004	Yes?
sgoluc005	Sure.
sgoluc006	If you don't mind waiting a few hours.
sgoluc007	Can I help it if I have a wide variety of interests that cause my mind to wander?
sgoluc008	Well, I never!
sgoluc009	It's all his fault.
sgoluc010	See that look of concentration on his face?
sgoluc011	He's trying to divine the outcomes of every possible move, through sheer force of will.
sgoluc012	It's a very time-consuming process.
sgoluc013	Well, pardon me for being able to hold two thoughts in my head at the same time!
sgoluc014	Oh no.  This will take hours.
sgoluc015	It's hard to say...
sgoluc016	I've been pressing Señor Castaneda's queen with my Montgolfier Offensive.
sgoluc017	But I think the miserable git's got me stymied with his Estrada Barricade.
sgoluc018	I believe that Señor Castaneda is trying to shnooker me with a predictable Nostromo Gambit.
sgoluc019	But I've closed that off with my cunning use of the flamboyant Cochran Defense.
sgoluc020	It's too close to call.
sgoluc021	WHERE?
sgoluc022	Noticed that, did you?
sgoluc023	Señor Castaneda is exceptionally well-disciplined.
sgoluc024	Once he sets his mind to a task, it's nearly impossible to shift his attention.
sgoluc025	Except...
sgoluc026	Well, he DOES carry something of a torch for Brittany, the Bank Teller.
sgoluc027	Oh yes.  He carries a picture of Brittany with him wherever he goes.
sgoluc028	Thank you.
sgoluc029	Heh, heh, heh, heh...Oooh, good move!
sgoluc030	You bet your bony butt I am.
sgoluc031	Who was it told me that 'Rules are rules, tubbo?'
sgoluc032	You call THAT a move?  THIS is a move!
sgoluc033	Oh, yeah?  Who's gonna stop me?
sgoluc034	Nose Goblin!
sgoluc035	Doily Sniffer!
sgoluc036	Fringe Candidate!
sgoluc037	Soft Rocker!
sgoluc038	Weasel Worrier!
sgoluc039	Monkey Molester!
stasta001	Why, if it isn't my old friend, er, Bob!
stasta002	Of course it is, of course it is!
stasta003	Welcome to Stan's Real Estate Emporium!
stasta004	Where a deal's a deal and the real estate is real!
stasta005	What can I do for you, young man?
stasta006	Do yourself a favor and read them.
stasta007	They're full of all sorts of great information about Stan's Time Shares!
stasta008	Take one!  They're free!
stasta009	That's the kind of guy I am!  Just giving things away!
stasta010	Turned into a dead-end.
stasta011	Get it?  Dead-end.  Ha ha ha!!
stasta012	Seriously, no money in it any more.  It just dried up.
stasta013	All my clients were dying and becoming ghosts just to collect on their policies.
stasta014	Oh well, gotta remain flexible, kid.  Know what I mean?
stasta015	Time-shares are the wave of the future.
stasta016	Ah, it's a beautiful day!
stasta017	How can you work inside on a day like this!?
stasta018	Just a, um, small problem with the local vermin.
stasta019	It's the problem that's small; the vermin themselves are actually quite large.
stasta020	But it's nothing to worry about; it'll be taken care of right away!
stasta021	It's just a minor setback.  What's important is that the time-share units are, legally-speaking, practically vermin free!
stasta022	T-t-t-time-shares, my good man.
stasta023	Looking for a second home?
stasta024	Investment property?
stasta025	A little extra income?
stasta026	Look no further!
stasta027	You can't afford not to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!
stasta028	And, for the next twenty-four hours, for just listening to my pitch, you get a coupon for a free Monkey Mug at Planet Threepwood!
stasta029	(Limit one per customer, while supplies last.  Void where prohibited by law and in the state of Wyoming.)
stasta030	It'd be my pleasure, my pantalooned friend!
stasta031	You have to be touched in the head not to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!
stasta032	As a bonus, just for listening to my pitch, I'll give you a coupon for a free Monkey Mug at Planet Threepwood!
stasta033	Why?  Are you looking for one?
stasta034	Not just now, but perhaps I can acquire some...
stasta035	...if the mark-up is substantial.
stasta036	How many units do you think I could push?
stasta037	Ozzie Mandrill?
stasta038	Let me tell you something about Ozzie Mandrill, kid.
stasta039	Ozzie Mandrill doesn't know squat about being a real entrepreneur.
stasta040	He doesn't know the thrill of haggling, the ecstasy of a hard-earned sale, the agony of a lost customer...
stasta041	All Ozzie wants are orderly lines of zombies, queuing up to purchase his pre-fabricated, pre-priced, pre-processed garbage!
stasta042	I ask you, kid, where's the fun in that, huh?  Where's the love?
stasta043	Not even an interview.
stasta044	You can't afford to wait too long!  This deal won't last!
stasta045	Okay, but you already got the free coupon.  You only get one.
stasta046	Smart decision, my friend!  You'll thank me after you've heard about this exciting opportunity.
stasta047	Stay with me, the full pitch takes, um, just under three hours!
stasta048	Your loss.
stasta049	Be prepared to be stunned by what I have to tell you!
stasta050	What's the best investment for your hard-earned cash?
stasta051	The stock market?
stasta052	No, too volatile.
stasta053	Duck food futures?
stasta054	No, ducks have short life-spans.
stasta055	Porcelain figurines?
stasta056	Uh oh.  Oops, too fragile.
stasta057	What then?
stasta058	Two words!
stasta059	Time share!!!
stasta060	That's right!  Real estate!
stasta061	Let me show you how a small investment today can compound into an incredible fortune in just a, um, few short generations!
stasta062	So who's excited and ready to invest, huh?
stasta063	You bet!  Gotta check with the missus.  Wouldn't want to wind up in the ol' doghouse, aroo-hoo?
stasta064	Right!  Well, thanks for listening!
stasta065	Have this coupon for a free Monkey Mug at Planet Threepwood from your old friend Stan!
stasta066	Hey!  Wake up!
stasta067	You musta dozed off, pal.
stasta068	Hey, no skin off my nose.
stasta069	I'm not the one that's gonna miss out on this once-in-a-millennium opportunity!
stasta070	Come back when you're ready to hear the whole pitch.
stasta071	You know where to find me!
stasta072	If you think it's pretty now, imagine how much nicer it'll be with the addition of three dozen picturesque time-share holiday bungalows!
stasta073	Variety, son!  The spice of life!  An empty beach is about as exciting as a blank canvas, knowhatimean?
stasta074	Well, you don't want to lose a customer on account of dirty underwear, know what I mean, kid?
stasta075	I see you've noticed our colorful brochures!
stasta076	Hey there, guy!  No need to go inside!
stasta077	I'm right here!  It's a beautiful day, so let's all stay outside, okay?
telban001	Bank policy, sir.  I can't convert these traveler's checks because we've never heard of, what's this name?  'Aus-tra-li-a.'
telban002	We've had a bad run of counterfeit money come through here lately, so we've had to tighten our policy.
telban003	And if you ask me, these don't look real.  Hee.
telban004	Besides the funny name, there's a picture of a strange animal on here, that has another one popping out of its belly.
telban005	See, there you go.  'Kangaroo.'  Another funny name.  It's funny to say, too.  Hee.  Kangaroo.  Kangaroo...  Hee hee.
telban006	Have a nice day, Mister Mandrill.
telban007	Kangaroo.  Kangaroe.  Kang...  Kangaroo... Kanga... Kangaroo!  Kangaroo.  Heh.
telban008	There he is!!!
telban009	Welcome to the Second Bank of Lucre.
telban010	I'm Brittany, how may I help you?
telban011	Nothing.  It was our public relations department's idea.
telban012	They felt that being called the 'First' bank didn't project an image of experience.
telban013	Do you have an account here?
telban014	Then what else can I do for you?
telban015	All right, sir.
telban016	And what would the funds be used for?
telban017	Fine, sir.  And whose name is it under?
telban018	I see.  This is for Governor Marley.  Do you have power of attorney to act on her behalf?
telban019	Hee hee.  Not good enough.
telban020	Oh my!  Hee.  That will be fine, sir.
telban021	Just a moment.
telban022	Mister Quidworth?  There's a gentleman here to use the vault.
telban023	Have a nice day.
telban024	What's wrong with the way it is now?
telban025	Oh, I see.  And do you have a job?
telban026	Okay.  Of course, I'll need to talk to the existing crew first.
telban027	That sounds perfectly reasonable.
telban028	Do you have a job?
telban029	Oooh, life-size chocolate pirate ship...
telban030	With loans for edible items, we tend to charge a higher interest rate.
telban031	Then what can I do for you?
telban032	I see.  And what's your salary?
telban033	I see.  And what does that pay?
telban034	Oh, I'm sorry.
telban035	We don't extend credit to people with no practical skills.
telban036	Thanks for your time.  Someone will contact you in 3 to 5 business years.
telban037	Okay.  Hee hee.  What else can I do for you?
telban038	Oh, hi.
telban039	Why do you sound like a sick kraken?
telban040	Oh, it's all right.  I didn't like working at that bank that much anyway.
telban041	I've always really wanted to be in show business.  Hee!
telban042	Well, I always wanted to get into show business.
telban043	You're funny, Mister Threepwood.  Ha ha ha haha.
telban044	The bank is no concern of mine anymore.
telban045	Oh <gasp, gasp> oh <gasp> who?
telban046	I wanna be a singer, and have my own back up dancers.
telban047	I don't have any skills or experience, but I figure, with the right attitude, there's no stopping me.  Hahaha.
telban048	Mmmm, I don't think so.
telban049	I'm looking for someone a little more...
telban050	Mmm...cool.
telban051	I was making ends meet while I put my act together.
telban052	Guess I needed the push.  I was getting too wrapped up in the whole financial system thing.  Hmmm <giggle>
telban053	Oh, yes, I know.  Poor Santos.
telban054	He's so tragically intense.  Macho, but sensitive.
telban055	But, he's so busy playing that stupid old game with his buddy, it's... it's like I don't exist sometimes.
telban056	Hey.  I have a dream.  Wanna hear it?
telban057	Someday, when I'm rich and famous, he'll look up from that chessboard for a second, and suddenly realize what he missed out on.
telban058	Ironic, huh?
telban059	Ewww.  Quit it.  That's creepy.
telban060	Besides, he can't even advance my career anymore, now that the bank is closed.  Tee hee!
telban061	Can you make me a star?
telban062	Do you know anyone who can?
telban063	Ooh, tsk.  Oh well.
telban064	If you think of someone, let me know.
thrlaw001	Come in!
thrlaw002	What can we do for you?
thrlaw003	What is it?  Wrongful dismemberment?
thrlaw004	That doesn't sound very...
thrlaw005	Well, that changes things.
thrlaw006	...he's joking about the wife thing.
thrlaw007	You know, it's illegal to make such wrongful...
thrlaw008	...claims.
thrlaw009	Hmm, yes... we could sue them...
thrlaw010	...file a Writ of Habeas Moneyous.
thrlaw011	Earned, not given.
thrlaw012	What do you need from us, young fellow?
thrlaw013	Right.
thrlaw014	Nope.
thrlaw015	But, we'll get right on it!
thrlaw016	...and take a lot of research.
thrlaw017	...take in the sights?
thrlaw018	Oh, hey.  You might as well take this.
thrlaw019	This will save us a trip.
thrlaw020	We'll have to convince the court otherwise.
thrlaw021	Let's ask for an injunction.
thrlaw022	No, we really need to file for dismissal.
thrlaw023	Habeas habeas habeas.
thrlaw024	Two words, boys:  tough love.
thrlaw025	Follow the money.
thrlaw026	Who can we double-bill this time to?
thrlaw027	No body, no foul.
thrlaw028	Forget case law, we'll make it up.
thrlaw029	We'll subpoena everyone on the island.
thrlaw030	We'll just buy all the expert witnesses we need.
thrlaw031	You can't handle the truth!
thrlaw032	2 4 6 8, who wants to litigate!
thrlaw033	Alibi, shmalibi.
thrlaw034	They'll never know what hit them.
thrlaw035	I'll give them personal injury!
thrlaw036	Just object every chance you get.
thrlaw037	Where are my briefs?
thrlaw038	Is it time for lunch yet?
thrlaw039	If we knew where the body was, we could order an exhumation.
thrlaw040	Hey look, fellas.
thrlaw041	What is it?
thrlaw042	There are writs of nolo comprendes to research...
thrlaw043	To the Marley Mansion.
thrlaw044	Go to the bank and get the deed!
thrlaw045	To the Marley Mansion?
thrlaw046	If we had the Marley Mansion deed.
thrlaw047	Well, don't just stand there--
thrlaw048	Have you gone to the bank--
thrlaw049	The deed to the Marley Mansion.
thrlaw050	That's horrible!
thrlaw051	But we still need--
thrlaw052	Did someone say 'lawsuit?'
thrlaw053	Who do you want to sue?
thrlaw054	Who says sharks don't eat lawyers?
thrlaw055	A terrible tragedy?
thrlaw056	Neither do I.
thrlaw057	While LeChuck, being in a state of corpus transparantus, would be--
thrlaw058	Oh, that's easy...
thrlaw059	Which one?
thrlaw060	There's a lot of case law in this area.
thrlaw061	Possibly...
thrlaw062	How shall we put it?
thrlaw063	Bereft of funds.
thrlaw064	A small, dead turnip.
thrlaw065	Mandrill?
thrlaw066	He's too rich
thrlaw067	We have to stop him--
thrlaw068	That'd be unethical!
thrlaw069	WHAT?
thrlaw070	Please do.
trppla001	Whoa, flashback, man!  Marco de Pollo wins again!
trppla002	Whoa, dudes, this is unprecedented!  The newcomer has TIED Marco de Pollo!
trppla003	Dude, you've tied de Pollo again, bro!  Let's get set up for the tiebreaker round.
trppla004	Whoa, that was close, man.  But the winner is still...Marco de Pollo!
trppla005	The NEW All-World Plank Diving Champion is, uh...
trppla006	Whoah, man, it's really uncool to try an' bribe a diving judge!
trppla007	Duuude.
trppla008	Hey, little dude.  What's up?
trppla009	Dude, quit projecting your negative vibes, man.
trppla010	We could leave ourselves open to most grievous lawsuits if we let physically uncool people try to dive.
trppla011	Please turn to the right, dude.
trppla012	Here's your certificate; feel free to challenge our champion diver whenever you wanna dive.
trppla013	Haha.  Isn't it a trip?
trppla014	Hey, is that a variation on the Flying Finger, man?
trppla015	No way, dude.
trppla016	See ya, dude.
trppla017	No way, man.
trppla018	Oh, what is it, little diver dude?
trppla019	Oh, basically, there are four types of moves allowed in plank diving, man:
trppla020	Well, first, you got the Keelhaul, you know, a mellow, swan-like move that you can do by lifting your nose UP in the air.
trppla021	Next is the Rum Barrel, man, a somersault move that's easy to do by shoving your chin DOWN into your chest.
trppla022	The third move is the Spinning Swordsman, man.  That's a dangerous vertical spin that should only be started to the RIGHT.
trppla023	Finally, there's the Alpha Monkey, a chest-pounding maneuver that always starts with the LEFT hand.
trppla024	Okay, bro.  Pay attention to the moves that de Pollo makes, you know, and try and match 'em.
trppla025	For example, on his last dive he did a
trppla026	Keelhaul
trppla027	Rum Barrel
trppla028	Spinning Swordsman
trppla029	Alpha Monkey
trppla030	Combination.  So, if you wanted to match him you'd lean...?
trppla031	Ha ha.  You got it, man.
trppla032	Not a thing, broham.  It was primo!
trppla033	Eh, you really didn't get into the flow of de Pollo's groove, man.
trppla034	Hey, you got to match de Pollo's moves if you wanna be the dude.
trppla035	You're still not matching de Pollo's moves, dude.
trppla036	Hey, you got it, little dude.
trppla037	Hey, that's cool man, but you should tell de Pollo, not me.
trppla038	That sounds like a major bummer, dude, and I...I don't get involved in major bummers, you know.
trppla039	You got it, dude.  Woo-hoo!
trppla040	Dude, it's your turn to dive.  Get up there.
trppla041	Marco de Pollo is about to attempt a
trppla042	combination.
trppla043	Let's give him complete silence for this dive.  Shh...
trppla044	Yep, you're a certified diving dude.
trppla045	Please stay off the diving plank, man.  It's for competitors only.

uidl002	I got yer Ultimate Insult right here!
uidl004	I told you, you festering bucket of shark bait, I don't know anything about your supposed Ultimate Insult.
uidl005	And even if I did, I sure as Neptune's garters wouldn't tell an algae-swilling wannabe like you.
uigb001	Say, you don't happen to know anything about the Ultimate Insult, do you?
uigb003	Sounds like a big "yes" to me.
uigb006	Yikes, this looks complicated.
voovoo001	You pulled?
voovoo002	Ah, Guybrush.
voovoo003	I knew you'd return.
voovoo004	How can I help you?
voovoo005	Yes, it is I.
voovoo006	Who can say?
voovoo007	Perhaps it's because we share an unspoken, magikal bond...
voovoo008	Perhaps the fates have intertwined our destinies...
voovoo009	Or maybe I've got an unbreakable five-game deal with LucasArts™.
voovoo010	In any event, I'm here to help.
voovoo011	How can I assist you, Guybrush Threepwood?
voovoo012	I see that you are finally ready to ask me about the Ultimate Insult.
voovoo013	What would you like to know about it?
voovoo014	I can tell that you're still confused about the Ultimate Insult.
voovoo015	What would you like to know?
voovoo016	I sense that you want to know the connection between the Marley Heirlooms and the Ultimate Insult.
voovoo017	Hmmm, that IS a problem.  Let me see those heirlooms...
voovoo018	Ah, I sense powerful voodoo forces at work here...
voovoo019	Weddings, nuptials, bands of gold, reveal to us a gift that's old!
voovoo020	Lacey veils and pre-nups, too, show us the symbol of something new!
voovoo021	Bridesmaids tinged with jealous sorrow, bring to light a present borrowed!
voovoo022	One heart beats where once were two, the final gift is something blue!
voovoo023	Hmmm... the final gift is something blue!
voovoo024	Yes.  There should be a fourth wedding gift in here.  A BLUE wedding gift.
voovoo025	But my mystic senses detect nothing.
voovoo026	I don't think so.
voovoo027	My voodoo instincts tell me it's somewhere on Mêlée Island™.  How curious.
voovoo028	Only that it's somewhere on Mêlée Island™.
voovoo029	If Grandpa Marley was telling the truth, they hold the key to finding the Ultimate Insult.
voovoo030	If it were me, I'd find the woman who wore those earrings.
voovoo031	The cards have foretold that you seek direction.
voovoo032	I can see that you're still fumbling for direction.
voovoo033	I sense that you wish to dabble in the dangerous voodoo arts.
voovoo034	What did you have in mind?
voovoo035	I can tell that you're still interested in my voodoo wares.
voovoo036	Did you have anything in particular in mind?
voovoo037	My mystic eye sees precious time wasted in idle chit-chat.
voovoo038	I sense that your desire to waste time in pointless gossip has not been sated.
voovoo039	Go ahead.
voovoo040	I did...but I sensed that I was needed here, on Mêlée.
voovoo041	Besides, the incessant clucking on Puerto Pollo was driving me mad.
voovoo042	Yes...
voovoo043	But perhaps my voodoo senses were on the fritz.
voovoo044	I'm a voodoo priestess, not a political pundit.
voovoo045	But I will say this...
voovoo046	Charles L. Charles gives me the willies.
voovoo047	True.
voovoo048	He's a creepy politician, what more is there to know?
voovoo049	What, and spoil the surprise?
voovoo050	THAT is an excellent question, Guybrush.
voovoo051	What?
voovoo052	Oh, that.
voovoo053	About a month ago, a mysterious overseas investor began buying up all of Mêlée Island™ from the local pirates.
voovoo054	Those that wouldn't sell have been challenged to various forms of Insult Games:
voovoo055	...Insult Sword Fighting, Insult Golf, Insult Darts, Insult Arm Wrestling, you get the idea...
voovoo056	Strangely, this investor always wins.  He's the best insulter the Tri-Island Area has ever seen.
voovoo057	Eventually, even the craftiest of Mêlée's pirates have been forced to sell...
voovoo058	After wagering their homes and businesses in ever-escalating rounds of Insult Gaming.
voovoo059	How many pirates do you know that can resist a duel?
voovoo060	In any event, the few pirates remaining on Mêlée Island™ live in constant fear of being challenged by this foreign investor.
voovoo061	Only that he comes from a faraway exotic place, called 'Sydney'.
voovoo062	My name is...
voovoo063	...not important.
voovoo064	Do not taunt the fates, Threepwood.
voovoo065	The truth of my name will be revealed when the time is right, and no sooner.
voovoo066	Like what?
voovoo067	What goes up, must come down.
voovoo068	But what's more important is WHERE it comes down.
voovoo069	-sigh-
voovoo070	Gravity is your friend...
voovoo071	Use their own instruments against them.
voovoo072	It's a fairly simple procedure...
voovoo073	Get on your ship...
voovoo074	So find one.  Must I draw you a map?
voovoo075	Then... assemble your crew...
voovoo076	This is a PIRATE town.  Even in these economically depressed times, you should be able to find a couple of competent sailors.
voovoo077	...then sail to Lucre Island™.
voovoo078	That's what navigators are for, Guybrush.  I believe there's one in the SCUMM Bar.
voovoo079	That depends.  What do you know about politics?
voovoo080	Then, short of stuffing the ballot box, I don't see how you can help her.
voovoo081	But if you get caught, the Mêlée Town Council will string you up, stuff you with crawdads, and let pirates whack you like a piñata.
voovoo082	Perhaps it would be best if you steered clear of the election.
voovoo083	You must allow your wife the space she needs to tend her own path.
voovoo084	That's for you to discover, but I DO know that it is a path fraught with danger, voodoo, and monkeys!
voovoo085	You must discover the secrets of the Ultimate Insult to prevail over these twin agents of evil.
voovoo086	Find the Ultimate Insult.  That is the path you need to follow.
voovoo087	Very well.
voovoo088	I sense that you want to know WHAT the Ultimate Insult is.
voovoo089	Sssh!
voovoo090	The Ultimate Insult is the most coveted and dangerous voodoo item the world has ever known.
voovoo091	Twice as coveted, and five times as dangerous!
voovoo092	It is a powerful talisman that allows its owner to spew incredibly foul insults.
voovoo093	But these are no ordinary insults, Threepwood.
voovoo094	These are insults spoken in an ancient, forgotten tongue...
voovoo095	...insults so vile, so emotionally crippling...
voovoo096	...that they transform even the fiercest of pirates into an ego-less mass of goo...
voovoo097	...Permanently!
voovoo098	You'd think that, wouldn't you?  But the language used by the Ultimate Insult is SO ancient that it's rumored to be the primal language...the tongue from which all other languages arose.
voovoo099	Amplified by the voodoo magiks of the Ultimate Insult, this original language has the power to speak to the very heart of a person's soul...and mock it into oblivion.
voovoo100	Indeed.
voovoo101	I see that you want to know HOW to make an Ultimate Insult.
voovoo102	Sadly, I have no idea how to make an Ultimate Insult talisman.
voovoo103	Yes, but the Ultimate Insult was outlawed dozens of years ago...
voovoo104	...in the aftermath of a terrible battle between two Ultimate Insult-wielding houngans that shattered the egos of an entire chain of islands!
voovoo105	And bad for business.
voovoo106	As a face-saving gesture, the United Voodoo Workers of the Tri-Island Area agreed to gather up and destroy all known copies of the Ultimate Insult recipe, lest one ever be assembled again!
voovoo107	I see that you want to know WHERE to find the makings of an Ultimate Insult.
voovoo108	As I said, the instructions to build an Ultimate Insult have been destroyed.
voovoo109	However, I seem to recall that the individual pieces of an Ultimate Insult can only be found on one island.
voovoo110	Hmmmm...no, too obvious.
voovoo111	It was some other island entirely.  Unfortunately, this island's name has also been lost to the vagaries of time.
voovoo112	It's a horrifically powerful voodoo talisman that can shatter men's souls through the power of ancient insults.
voovoo113	I have no idea.
voovoo114	On an island.  I don't know which one.
voovoo115	Sorry, we're fresh out.  We're expecting a shipment from Dinky Island™ early next week, though.
voovoo116	Those ARE nice, aren't they?
voovoo117	No.  It's been a bad year for unspoiled eyeballs.
voovoo118	Perhaps.  What are your current stats?
voovoo119	Well then, what good would a strength elixir do?
voovoo120	You're telling me.
voovoo121	Tragically, our shipment from Booty Island™ is also running late.
voovoo122	You don't need a sword to send your foes into a stupor, my child...just be yourself.
voovoo123	I left my gum machine in Puerto Pollo.
voovoo124	You might want to try the SCUMM Bar, if you're really hungry.
voovoo125	As you wish, Guybrush.
voovoo126	I'll be here later, if you need me.
waikit001	That funky monkey!
wailua001	Welcome to the LUA Bar.
wailua002	I'll be right with you.
wailua003	Can I help you?
wailua004	Oh, we're under new management now.  We've done away with all the pirates, swill, and wenches.  Ooh!
wailua005	What can I get you?
wailua006	Oh, the sushi is all very good.
wailua007	Our chef is one of the best there is.
wailua008	Are you for real?  Everyone's eating it these days.
wailua009	Okay, it's raw fish, artistically prepared with natural ingredients from the sea.
wailua010	Well, we do have a heated dish for the less trendy people like you.
wailua011	Try the flaming scuttlefish.
wailua012	Sure!  What can I get you?
wailua013	Then excuse me.  I have customers waiting.
wailua014	Excuse me.  I have customers waiting.
wailua015	We don't have that.
wailua016	But we do have a fine selection of tropical drinks.
wailua017	I'm not sure what that is, but I know we don't carry it.
wailua018	Can I interest you in a fine tropical drink?  They come with cute little umbrellas.
wailua019	Okay, let me know when you've decided.
wailua020	I'll let you think about it.
wailua021	Well, we have a few specialties...
wailua022	Deep Blue Sea with a Coral Reef Chaser,
wailua023	Monkfish Mango Madness,
wailua024	and Barnacle's and Jayme's Brine Cooler.
wailua025	We have many more.  You're welcome to peruse our menu of drink suggestions.
wailua026	I've been serving drinks in bars for months.  I've never known a bar to serve grog.
wailua027	What else can I get ya?
wailua028	Looks like you've maybe had too much already.  If you don't calm down, I'll have to cut you off.
wailua029	Okay, let me know when you decide.
wailua030	Ew, gross.  Nobody likes real pirates anymore.
wailua031	That's so last week.
wailua032	We've replaced that old swill with family-friendly fun beverages.
wailua033	We have quite a selection.
wailua034	Our decorators went for realism without the fright.
wailua035	They insisted that we replace the wenches with totems and bamboo.
wailua036	Drink sales are down, but we can turn the lights on again.
wailua037	Try the flaming scuttlefish.  It's for people like you.
wailua038	Excellent choice, sir.
wailua039	We're required to say that.  Your order will be up shortly.
wailua040	Try the flaming scuttlefish.  It's the only thing that isn't served raw.
wailua041	Sushi, duh.
wailua042	Oh, and something called the flaming scuttlefish.
wailua043	Hey!  Hey!  Don't touch that!
wailua044	That's an expensive collectable.
wailua045	I told you to leave that alone!
wailua046	Why don't you have a seat first?
whilaw001	Come in!
whilaw002	Of course we can!
whilaw003	Hurt your back while pillaging another ship?
whilaw004	...lucrative.
whilaw005	Nice use of the TM.
whilaw006	Oh, I get it...
whilaw007	Should we sue him?
whilaw008	...put a lien on their catapult...
whilaw009	...we would be given a lot of money?
whilaw010	Yes, the 'Preferred Legal Team of the Governor's Office™'.
whilaw011	Right.
whilaw012	Nope.
whilaw013	Right!
whilaw014	Actually, this may take a while.
whilaw015	Isn't there something else you could do for a while?
whilaw016	It was supposed to be delivered after his granddaughter got married.
whilaw017	Now, begone!  We have work to do!
whilaw018	We'll have to convince the court otherwise.
whilaw019	Let's ask for an injunction.
whilaw020	No, we really need to file for dismissal.
whilaw021	Habeas habeas habeas.
whilaw022	Two words, boys:  tough love.
whilaw023	Follow the money.
whilaw024	Who can we double-bill this time to?
whilaw025	No body, no foul.
whilaw026	Forget case law, we'll make it up.
whilaw027	We'll subpoena everyone on the island.
whilaw028	We'll just buy all the expert witnesses we need.
whilaw029	You can't handle the truth!
whilaw030	2 4 6 8, who wants to litigate!
whilaw031	Alibi, shmalibi.
whilaw032	They'll never know what hit them.
whilaw033	I'll give them personal injury!
whilaw034	Just object every chance you get.
whilaw035	Where are my briefs?
whilaw036	Is it time for lunch yet?
whilaw037	If we knew where the body was, we could order an exhumation.
whilaw038	Perhaps we should drop this case.
whilaw039	Hey!  Get away from that!
whilaw040	Yes?
whilaw041	...subpoenas of e plurubus unum to serve...
whilaw042	It WOULD go faster--
whilaw043	If we had the original deed--
whilaw044	Well, don't just stand there--
whilaw045	And retrieved the deed--
whilaw046	Not yet.
whilaw047	MUCH faster.
whilaw048	Go to the bank and get the deed!
whilaw049	To the Marley Mansion?
whilaw050	We're almost done--
whilaw051	Why?
whilaw052	And?
whilaw053	Do you need representation?
whilaw054	Maybe you SHOULD.
whilaw055	That sounds...
whilaw056	Once they've signed all the appropriate corpus delecti waivers.
whilaw057	A horrible waste?
whilaw058	Do the families of these lawyers have proper representation?
whilaw059	Did he get proper representation at his trial?
whilaw060	You hook him up to a reliable...
whilaw061	Lie detector apparatus.
whilaw062	Henderson v. St. Peter?
whilaw063	Maybe...
whilaw064	Poor.
whilaw065	A small turnip.
whilaw066	Ozzie?
whilaw067	Too powerful.
whilaw068	First things first, Mister Threepwood.
whilaw069	We can't sue a ghost!
whilaw070	And besides, there's no money in it!
yanpta001	--and that's why keelhauling is bad.
yanpta002	Yes, ma'am?
yanpta003	Yes, Miss Rivers?
yanpta004	Ha!
yanpta005	Why?  I got every answer right!
yanpta006	This is horribly unfair.
yanpta007	Curses.
yanpta008	I politely give the stranger the correct time, and point him in the direction of a watch shop.
yanpta009	I make a mental note of the assailant's appearance, and seek out the nearest peace officer.
yanpta010	I put the map in the book and alert the librarian.
yanpta011	I chalk it up as a learning experience, and move on.
yanpta012	I grudgingly eat the burger while hoping the service improves during my next visit.
yanpta013	I hail the captain of the passing vessel, and ask him if he needs any assistance.
yanpta014	I have a good chuckle at my own expense, and toast my friend's rapier-like wit.
yanpta015	I feel a small degree of superstitious, irrational fear, but press on with my duties.
yanpta016	I politely, but firmly, decline his offer.
yanpta017	Oh, yeah, like THAT'S the right answer.
yanpta018	You're gonna flunk!
yanpta019	Ooooh, you're gonna get it!
yanpta020	Miss Rivers, Guybrush is hampering my ability to learn.
yanpta021	Miss Rivers, I think Guybrush needs a time out.
yanpta022	Miss Rivers?  I'm feeling sick to my stomach.
yoslua001	Yes?
yoslua002	SCUMM Bar?
yoslua003	What's that?
yoslua004	Sounds disgusting.
yoslua005	Do you like sushi?
yoslua006	Mmmm... you need to ease into it, then.
yoslua007	Order something that isn't raw to start with, and then work your way to the good stuff.
yoslua008	Ooh the unagi?  Heh, heh, heh, that's the best!
yoslua009	Does it show?
yoslua010	When I travel, I try not to look like a tourist.
yoslua011	I like to really get to know the place I'm visiting.
yoslua012	That doesn't sound like much fun.  This is plenty authentic enough for me, thank you.
yoslua013	Sure.
